","keywords":" ","article_body":" When dealing with <b>acne skin care</b>, most of the medical professionals commonly suggest that people affected with acne must practice certain acne skin care methods that will help improve the condition of their skin. Acne, as you may already know, is a very severe skin disorder that affects thousands of people from all over the world. It not only affects the surface of the skin but also the inner layers of the skin. Acne usually occurs on the face, neck, chest and back, and it starts during the adolescence period. During the past several years, a good number of acne experts and skin care professionals have conducted many studies on how to prevent the formation of acne. And fortunately, these skin care specialists have come out with certain acne skin care tips that can be of great help for fighting acne. I have selected the three simpler yet most powerful acne skin care tips that you can follow in order to have a healthier skin. These are mentioned below <B>Acne Skin Care Tip # 1 You Should Always Clean Your Skin Very Gently</B> First of all, personal hygiene is very necessary for fighting acne. So as what most experts usually suggest, you should gently clean your skin with a mild cleanser at least twice a day.  This simple acne skin care step is deemed important for fighting acne since washing your face or the other affected areas will wipe away the acne-causing bacteria found on the skin. Also note that although you are sometimes told to scrub your face, scrubbing is not a good acne skin care move since it will just trigger the development of acne, worsening the condition. In addition to this acne skin care step, it is worth noting that astringents are not always suggested unless the skin is very oily. And, they must only be applied on the oily spots. <B>Acne Skin Care # 2 You Should Refrain from Frequently Holding Your Skin</B> Another helpful acne skin care tip is to avoid frequently handling of the skin. Don&#8217;t pinch, pick or squeeze your pimple since it will only worsen the condition. Many of the people have considered this acne skin care step as one of the most important acne skin care pointers knowing that it may only cause infection and scars formation. As this acne skin care tip holds, you should avoid rubbing and touching your skin lesions if possible. <B>Acne Skin Care # 3 Always Choose Cosmetics Carefully</B> This last acne skin care tip holds that people who are being treated for acne must change some of the cosmetics they use. Note that in order to avoid the onset or the development of acne, the cosmetics you plan on using like the foundation, blush, moisturizers, and eye shadow should be oil free. Aside from that, this acne skin care tip also holds that you must avoid oily hair products for they may cause closed comedones. Therefore, those products that are labeled as noncomedogenic should be applied. It is a fact that many of us are very conscious of our skin condition. And as such, we are always wanting to have a fresh, good-looking skin as much as possible. Unfortunately, many of us also fail to come to the conclusion that simple steps are the best ways to accomplish this goal. We often are blind enough that we don&#8217;t see what&#8217;s really right or wrong for our skin. We often fall in so much frustration and desperation that make us go buy any high-priced beauty products that in the end just turn out to be a waste of time and money, and even worsen our acne. Hopefully, the above mentioned <i>acne skin care</i> tips will be a good start to help you enhance your skin condition.

People have this misconception that acne only happens during teenage years and gradually wears off as they age. For most people, this fact may be true but it is important to note that acne does not start during teenage years only. However, it is important to note that there are a significant number of adults that experience such condition. There are lots of reasons why a person develops adult acne. But, it is important to take note that majority of the people that suffers from this condition are those who also experienced acne problems during their teens.

A lot of adults have this desire to squeeze or prick their zits on their own which could cause further damage due to scars. Never ever do that because squeezing will only push the infection deep into the skin. 4.    Fourth, eat healthy foods. In order to flush away toxins that could cause acne, you need to drink lots of water and eat fruits and vegetables. Keep in mind that well-hydrated skin has better chances to rejuvenate rather than dry skin. Also, try to live a healthy lifestyle by having a well-rested body.

","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" Luckily, there are a number of things you can do everyday to make sure your skin is less prone to flare ups. Here are five tips for taking control of your acne starting today. 1. Exercise - Keeping in shape can help fight acne by fighting off negative stress levels that can come from negative self-esteem and depression. However, some safeguards need to be in place to ward off acne that can result from your workout routines. Watch what you put on your body with regards to clothing, sports gear and equipment. For example, tight lycra and nylon exercise outfits might look great in the movies and on magazine models, but if you are susceptible to acne problems, avoid these synthetic fabrics that tend to trap in body moisture and heat resulting in a bacteria frenzy. Instead, choose loose clothing made of cotton or natural blends to allow more air to get to your skin. And when you are finished with your workout, get out of clothing wet from perspiration or water sports. Shower and change into dry, clean clothing. And keep your sports gear and equipment clean, too. Dirty headgear, for instance, can irritate forehead areas prone to acne problems. So toss headbands into the washing machine after workout sessions. 2. Cosmetics - To avoid pore-clogging and skin irritations that are similar to acne and that can contribute to acne, use products labeled noncomedogenic or oil-free. Shimmering facial colors can contain a flaky mineral called mica that can cause skin irritations and clog pores. Other additives in coloring that can cause similar reactions are coal tar derivatives, carmine and heavy cream in blushes. More preventative measures include using a lip gloss that promotes a matte finish instead of a high gloss for less pore-clogging; note the more the shine, the more then comedogenic content and the more the pores can clog. Beware that eye creams can contain heavier concentrations of moisturizers than regular creams and lotions, meaning they have greater potential to clog pores in the surrounding facial areas. 3. Diet - Studies show that diet does not play a role in either the cause or the treatment of acne. However, what is recommended for acne preventative care is this what is best for your body is best for your skin, especially since your skin is the largest organ of your body. So remember to watch your diet and consume healthy vitamins, minerals and other supplements. This will help to prevent and help conquer acne breakout. 4. Hygiene - A healthy skin regimen should include no harsh scrubbing or over-washing, because this can cause possible skin irritation or possible over production of oil to replace what has washed off, clogging pores in the process. Products with gentle exfoliation ingredients are OK to use; i.e. not scratchy nut or fruit shell pieces that can tear skin. And skip alcohol products when possible; these can take off the top layer of your skin and cause your glands to product more oil, clogging pores in the process. If you do spot acne-troubled areas, do NOT mess with them. Remember that these are already weeks in the making, and squeezing or picking blemishes can force the infected area to regress back inside, further troubling the region and possibly leave a scar. If necessary, seek help from a dermatologist for alternative treatments. 5. Shaving - Shaving for both genders is actually an excellent way of exfoliating or removing dead skin to help with the prevention and spreading of acne instead of leaving the remains to clog pores. And for some light acne cases already in process, shaving can help rid whiteheads and blackheads from the face. A word of caution for areas with infection or high inflammatory activity (redness, sensitive, open acne, sores, etc.), do not shave. Or at the very least, use a shaving cream for sensitive skin!

Experts have said that they irritate the skin, which should be left intact as a natural barrier against the acne-causing bacteria. 2. Sun for Beautiful Skin As you may know, sun does kill bacteria, but it doesn't mean that it won't harm the skin. Note that the sun also acts as an astringent that dries, tightens and clogs the skin pores. Thus, you should just spend limited time under the sun. At least 15 minutes to the face and arms daily is enough. 3. Avoid Extremely Cold Weather If extreme heat causes clogging of the pores, extremely cold weather causes it as well. So, avoid extremely cold weather so you don't freeze and clog pores. It is ideal that you moisturize your face and body, and stay in temperatures ranging from 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. 4. Swimming Does Help Exercise for stress reduction by swimming in a properly treated indoor swimming pool. But, use the Ozone purified pool if possible. It is interesting to know that the swimming pool water is typically 75 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit, which is well below the normal temperature of 98.6 degrees of your body. Therefore, the swimming water cools your whole body, including the acne affected areas, while providing excellent exercise to the rest of you. This even reduces stress as well as physical attention. 5. Think Clean Change linens, wash cloths and body towels after each use. It is for the fact that they are great places for acne-causing bacteria to grow and be reapplied to the skin later. Also, wash white facial cloths, pillow covers, as well as personal undergarments daily with Vinegar, tea tree oil or essential oils of Lime, lemon or orange so to lessen the acne-related bacterial development. It is also often suggested that you apply a natural detergent for washing. Indeed, there are a lot of ways to control and fight acne, but maintaining a healthy lifestyle is so far the best one to consider. It is important to note that healthy lifestyles will lead you to attaining a healthier skin and a healthier body. Changing your unfavorable habits will reward you with better general health, more energy, and clearer skin to show the world. If you were once afraid to make changes, please don't be. Of course, the initial affects may be hard to grasp at first, but as you go on, you will find out that you can quickly learn to adapt with them. This article is Copyright © 2006, Heather Colman.

Here are some natural and not so natural acne treatments that are proven to be effective. <b>1. Witch Hazel Astringent</b> This astringent comes from the plant with the same name. It is widely spread from Nova Scotia in Canada down to Texas and Florida. Simply steam the twigs of this plant and voila! The extract you get from it serves as your astringent. Remember to cool it though. What’s good about this is that it occurs naturally and even the process it has undergone is all natural. You can be assured it is less harsh compared with commercially-produced astringents. <b>2. Commercially Produced Astringents</b> There is no doubt that astringents we can buy over-the-counter are also effective. There are lots of variants to choose from with additional ingredients that promote better skin. The only downside is it can be a little harsh because of the chemicals added to produce this formula. Use them with extra care as they can dry the skin. <b>3. All-Natural Treatments</b> Kitchen and acne are two enemies we may not be aware of. Scout your kitchen for stuff like oranges and lemons, fresh garlic and raw potatoes. - Oranges and lemons just need to be squeezed on cotton balls. Apply the extract on      affected areas and wash it after about 20 minutes. - Fresh garlic is used much easier. Just remove its peeling and rub it on your face. - As for raw potatoes, peel them and rub its flat surface on your face. The natural extracts from these fruits and vegetables can help minimize the redness at the same time can clean the skin. <b>4. Oral Antibiotics</b> For severe cases, antibiotics are prescribed. These medications are orally taken to reduce the amount of bacteria inside and around skin follicles. They also decrease the exasperating chemicals that the white blood cells produce. Lastly, antibiotics diminish the concentration of the free fatty acids found in sebum, also creating an anti-inflammatory action. Consult your dermatologist for the right antibiotic and dosage. Tetracycline is still the most commonly prescribed antibiotic for acne treatment. Most of this antibiotic should be taken on an empty stomach. Also, this shouldn’t be used by pregnant women and children under 9. Usually, the starting dose is initially 500 milligrams twice daily and is continuously taken until prescribed, or until a considerable dropping off of lesions is visible. Erythromycin comes close second and can be prescribed to pregnant women. However, it can cause nausea and even upset stomach. Compared to tetracycline, which can only kill bacteria, Erythromycin has both anti-inflammatory and bacteria-killing properties. Also, this antibiotic needs to be taken in a food-filled tummy. You may discuss other possible antibiotics with your doctors regarding the effects and side-effects of each. <b>5. Topical Treatments</b> Externally applied creams are also proven effective for acne treatment. However, it results to drying and flaking but it is said to be the most effective treatment for severe acne. Benzoyl peroxide is one very common and effective topical acne treatment.

Here, I will share with you the most common 5 tips on getting rid of acne. <b>1.</b> One of the first ways that you can be successful in getting rid of acne is to engage in a diet that benefits the skin, as well as your health in general. Organic foods have recently started to gain in popularity  and for a very good reason. These particular foods are not processed.

Each of these glasses should be at least eight ounces. I know this seems like quite a bit of water, but it is a key element when it comes to purifying the body on the whole. The more water that moves through your body, the more clean and pure the inside of the body will be. When this happens, that purification will actually spread to the outside, or the skin.

This is the next way that you can work on getting rid of acne. All you have to do is focus on eating foods that have high levels of vitamins A, B12, B, E, B5, & B6. If you find that it is difficult sorting through the ingredients on everything that you eat or drink in order to maximize your exposure to these vitamins, you can purchase supplements. Many elect to simply take a multivitamin every single day. Then, there are some that purchase each of these vitamins and then rotate days on taking them. However, you decide to do it, it is important to just do it! You are sure to see immediate results when it comes to how clean and healthy your skin is! <b>4.</b> When it comes to getting rid of acne, many individuals are turning towards natural herbs.

And dry skin means your body will jump in and create more oil. Then what? Extra oil + extra dead skin cells = blocked pores, triggering acne flare-ups. Same old story. 5. - Add more fruits, veggies, seeds and nuts to your regular diet. (Note that deficiencies if selenium and zinc, found in Brazil nuts and pumpkin seeds, have been associated with acne.) So add salads, dried fruit and nut snacks, juices and other healthy treats to your daily planning. This report includes information based upon research about acne. It strives to help clear up myths from facts and present an overview of the issues surrounding acne along with possible solutions available to help with the prevention and treatment of acne, all based upon the most recent studies, reports, articles and findings available, so that you can learn more acne health care.

However I believe they genuinely want to help their patients, and will take your acne condition seriously. There are a number of simple steps you can take to ensure you maximise the chance of getting the right help from your doctor in treating your acne 1. A key skill in getting the best out of any situation is clear communication. Your doctor can only act on the information you give him about your condition. Not providing the ‘full story’ is the primary reason for misdiagnosis or a lack of urgent attention. Make sure you tell your doctor, how long you’ve had the acne, what treatments you’ve tried, where does the acne occur and is it worsened by reaction to stress of sunlight. 2. Ask questions about any aspect of your acne that you want to clarify. A good tip is to write down the questions you want to ask, before you speak to your doctor, to ensure you cover everything. Don't feel embarrassed by asking certain questions, remember there are 'no dumb questions' 3. Understand that there are no miracle cures for acne, and that you may have to try a number of different treatments before you find one, which is effective, against your particular type. 4. Make sure you mention the emotional side of how your acne makes you feel, if this is of particular concern to you. This is a vital area that is often overlooked, and is clearly important particularly if your acne is resulting in depression, or resulting in a reduction in your social interactions with others. 5. If your doctor prescribes any medication, make sure you fully understand 1) how to apply the treatment, 2)how long will it be before you see any improvement, 3)any side-effects that you may experience, 4)when do you need to return for a follow up, and 5)how long the treatment will last. These key questions will ensure you are fully informed about the treatment programme you are embarking on. Remember your doctor is there to help you overcome both the physical and emotional side of acne. If you don’t feel you can easily approach your doctor, find an alternative medical professional, such as a dermatologist. What ever you decide to do, ensure you seek help, and don’t let acne get the better of you.

","keywords":" acne, pimples, clear face, treating acne, beautiful skin, skin care ","article_body":" Would you like to find out what those-in-the-know have to say about Acne? The information in the article below comes straight from well-informed experts with special knowledge about Acne. Here are some tips that have helped hundreds of people suffering from acne.  Hopefully, these will help you too 1. Water is Best Water is by far the most effective treatment for acne.  The main support for this claim is the fact that water is alkaline (pH 7.3) and can be considered as a natural treatment or an almost free acne treatment.  Thus, it is best that you drink at least eight glasses of water per day (10 to 12 is better). This will help your body in getting rid of oil, waste and toxins, and water even helps to moisten your skin as it keeps your pores from clogging.  Perhaps what is most important is that, water helps to relieve stress and relax your body in the end, so you can have a better sleep. Note that water and sleep are factors that help reduce stress. Along with this, try to lessen your coffees, sodas, teas and alcohols intake as much as possible. The reason behind this is that they are partial diuretics that they drive more water out of the cells of the body than they put in. 2. Avoid Astringents If your goal is to have a beautiful skin, then you should try to avoid astringent natural soaps and any astringent agents that shrink your skin's pores, such as oatmeal, witch hazel, very cold water and rubbing alcohol.  It was found out actually that when your skin pores shrink, more oils are clogged in the pores of the skin, causing the onset of acne. 3. Avoid Stimulants Coffee, tea, cigarettes, as well as excessive sugar from sweets and soda should be avoided.  It is often said that anything potential for affecting the entire body, brain and nervous system can easily stimulate the sebaceous glands to release more oil.  This oil has to leave the body through the pores, worsening your acne in the end. Stimulants even trigger stress. 4. Watch Your Diet Note that diet affects acne.  So be careful with what you eat. As much as possible, try to eat foods that are low in fat, as fats produce more oils in the body that are capable of producing acne. 5. Avoid Alcohol A number of people think that alcohol is one of the best ways to relax and relieve stress.  Well, alcohol may do this, but studies have found out that alcohol causes the formation of acne.  It is considered capable for producing acne knowing that it is an astringent, thus it shrinks the skin pores, making them more prone to clogging.  Aside from that, alcohol inhibits sleep, therefore causing more fatigue and stress, leading to worse acne. 6. Hot and Very Cold Count When considering baths, you should avoid hot and very cold water on areas of the skin affected by acne. Use warm water instead; perhaps well below 98.5 degrees on your skin.

Yes, if you’re like me you have tried all of the popular products. But, what if I told you that in order to have clear skin you don’t have to spend hundreds of dollars every month. Actually, you may not have to spend any money. So, with all that said here is my simple 6 Steps To Clearer Skin (Yes, this is what I am doing to help my skin clear) 1. Drink lots of purified water. Look, many of us with acne problems continue to drinks all of these sodas that have a lot of acid, colors, etc. Soda can really mess up the face. Leave all sodas and other drinks on the market alone and stick to only purified water. Try these waters - Poland Springs, Volvic, Penta (expensive), Smart Water, or Dasani. Water does wonders to the body! 2. Drink lots of Green Tea (at least 1 to 2 times a day). Green Tea has many antioxidants that will help in decreasing your acne problems. Try purchasing the Celestial Seasonings Green Tea. 3. Eliminate any and all fried foods or greasy foods from your diet. Yes, I know many dermatologists will disagree with this. What I have found is that when I stopped eating fried or greasy foods my face automatically started clearing and improving to the point where I was receiving compliments almost everyday. Fried food carries too much grease that can cause big pimples to form in your face. Also many fast food places use old grease over and over again. Old or reused grease is one big block in your way if you’re trying to get clear skin. Not Good! 4. Eat a lot of vegetables (raw organic baby spinach is wonderful) and fruits everyday. Yeah I know you heard this before, but some of you are still not doing it. Vegetables and fruits alone. Many vegetables and fruits have antioxidants and vitamins that can help in healing and clearing the skin. 5. Use pure vitamin E oil (use the Nature’s Gate Brand) for your face. I am telling you, it will make your look good in about two to three months. Vitamin E oil has all the healing and antioxidant properties to help in clearing your skin. Apply to your face every night before going to bed. 6. Eliminate all stress. I know for some, stress can result in many breakouts on the face. Some individuals are not good at dealing with stress.  You know what, let the stress go! Enjoy these steps and take your time. Give yourself  3 to 6 months to see actual improvements in your skin. For these steps to work properly, please add each step to your daily routine. Each step must be performed on a daily basis. Consult your local dermatologist if you have any worries.

Avoid squeezing or popping your pimples and as much as possible prevent yourself from touching your outbreaks especially with unclean hands. The more you touch or squeeze the puss out of your acne, the more sebum your skin will produce.

However, make sure that the cream you will be using may not cause you allergies that can even worsen your current facial dilemma. 5. In case you are indulging yourself in some detoxification activities such as yoga or exercise, make sure that you wipe the sweat from your face immediately after the activity. 6. Use creams that have benzoyl peroxide as an active ingredient. But keep in mind that even these anti-acne products can still cause your skin to dry even though they help in healing your acne so you still need to use moisturizers. The stronger the medicine is, the higher percentage of benzoyl peroxide it contains. Some users testify that using creams with benzoyl peroxide is one of the best solutions on how to clear up acne.

One does need much money to get that healthy glowing skin, with the natural acne skin care methods, acne shouldn't be treated like monsters under your bed. Here are some acne skin care methods we can practice. <b>The power of water.</b> Oil, they say is thicker than water. But water is the plainest, most natural substance we can use for acne skin care. In washing your face, do it gently. Rubbing and scrubbing your face does not clean the skin gently. For best acne skin care effects, using a mild cleanser or toner once in the morning, noon and evening, and after doing a heavy work out, will help you achieve a clear skin. <b>Pick that zit.</b> People who prick pimples and blemishes as if pricking a bubble only aggravates the risk of skin inflammation and acne scars. Avoid hand contact with your face for better acne skin care results. <b>Shave with care.</b> Choose the best electric shavers and safety razors you can trust for years. They'll be more comfortable to use. Men need not use a super sharp blade to get rid of that beard. A regular shaver used with soap and water, or shaving cream will help you get that smooth finish. Doctors advised men to shave lightly, and shave only when necessary for acne skin care maintenance . <b>Sun of the beach!</b> If you love sun tanning or just want the sight of that sophisticated sunburnt look - forget it. This is an acne skin care no-no. The sun’s harmful ultra violet rays redden the skin, making the skin drier. It can make one’s blemishes visible, speed up aging and bring serious damage to the human skin. Also, excessive exposure to the sun can cause skin cancer. You don't want to ruin that great acne skin care you've been starting on with. <b>Cosmic Cosmetics.</b> Eye shadows, blush on, moisturizer, and other cosmetics we use should be free from oily substances to permit healthy acne skin care maintenance. Even hairstyling products in forms of gels or aerosols that come in close contact with the skin may destroy a healthy acne skin care practice. Choose hairstyling products, which are commercially labeled as non-comedogenic are products which do not provoke the formation and growth of blemishes and other related skin disorders. <b>Buttered Face.</b> An African beauty secret reveals the power of shea butter which originated from the Karite Nut Tree (or Mangifolia tree). Hmmm... juicy acne skin care tip! Karite Nut Tree was discovered in the semi-arid savannahs of West Africa and Central Africa. People in Africa, women in particular - rely in shea butter as a vital tool for acne skin care treatment for over centuries now. <b>Spare me that SPA!</b> You need not visit the most expensive spa parlors to get that destressing facial treatment to aid you in your acne skin care endeavor. Create a home made magical elixir right at the comforts of your own home by purchasing simple spa tools found in beauty stores. Get only the best and the FRESH. Increase intake of fresh fruit and vegetables. These acne skin care tools are free of toxins which decreases the speed of blood circulation. A salad or a fruit a day will keep an acne away! There is no perfect cure, medication, treatment or acne skin care methods for acne problems. Thus, as the sole proprietor of our own skin, we must take full charge of what lies to be our first armor against diseases and bodily injuries.

","keywords":" acne, acne treatment, acne products, acne skin care ","article_body":" Having that nasty zit is sometimes quite annoying. In fact, it is a great factor on suffering low self-esteem particularly on young people whose main focus at puberty is the physical attribute. Preventing acne breakout is not a piece of cake that is why even if you know everything about acne control, the acne still shows up every now and then. The lack of time to maintain acne free regimen daily contributes to the breakout. So how do you maintain your acne free skin?  Here’s how 1. Do not prick the acne affected area. Touching it with bare hands can cause further irritation. Unclean hands carry undesirable microorganism that can cause acne. So it is rather safe to keep your hands or any other object from your face to impede the inflammation of the acne and scarring of the skin as well. 2. Avoid using oil-based products on your hair. Guys and girls wear hair products to improve their appearance. Dermatologist might agree that the products are safe on the scalp however, this chemical-laden beauty products slide down to your face as you sweat out. The fluids goes down to the acne hence aggravate the already affected area of the skin. 3. Minimize the use of cosmetics over the pimple. It is alarming to know that although beauty products can conceal your pimple break out, it increases the risk of infection. The combination of the harsh compounds on your foundation makes up and bacteria that come with the sponge (if the foundation you are using is not newly opened) exacerbate the acne. If your job requires you to wear make up, you should avoid those generic brand make up. Some generic brands of make up do not mention the harsh chemicals that are present in the product. 4. If you are using alcohol-based and oil-based facial wash or toner, taking a break will somehow minimize the inflammation of the skin. 5. Avoid getting anything that might contain microorganism to touch your face. These include your unmanaged hair, dirty handkerchief, towels and even pillow. The only way to control the transfer of organism to your face from the material of origin is to always keep your hair in a bun or use a hair band that will keep it in place away from your face, a fresh pillowcase for your cushion, and clean towel and handkerchief to wipe your face. 6. An over-the-counter ointment can be bought from your local drugstore. A topical cream or ointment containing benzoyl peroxide is your best bet to vanish that undesired acne. Some dermatologist recommends tretinoin-based products cream over the benzoyl peroxide because of irritant threat on the peroxide content. Depending on how sensitive the skin is, you can choose from the two. 7. If the acne is severe, a visit to your dermatologist is needed. The dermatologist will prescribe oral antibiotic to take at a certain period of time. Or if applies, an adapalene gel will be prescribed by the dermatologist for you to use for time duration. Close monitoring of the medication is needed since like other prescription-required medicines, it might trigger unknown allergies.

Acne affects males and females worldwide, regardless of nationality. ","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" The most effective methods to combat acne include a combination of prevention and better skincare. Here are some of the ways you can use to prevent and treat acne 1. Exercise Regular exercise can help fight acne by fighting off negative stress levels that can come from negative self-esteem and depression. But avoid wearing tight lycra and nylon exercise outfits. These synthetic fabrics that tend to trap body moisture and heat, creating an ideal environment for bacteria to grow. Stick to loose clothing made of cotton or natural blends, and keep your sports gear and equipment clean. 2. Safe Cosmetics To avoid pore-clogging and skin irritations that can contribute to acne, use products labeled \"noncomedogenic\" or \"oil-free.\" Opt for \"hypo-allergenic\" perfumes and cosmetics to avoid allergic reactions and skin irritation. Coal tar derivatives, carmine and heavy cream in blushes can cause reactions. Shimmering facial colors can contain a flaky mineral called mica that can cause skin irritations and clog pores. Use a lip gloss with a matte finish for less pore-clogging. The more the shine, the more then comedogenic content and the more your pores can clog. 3. Healthy Diet Studies show that diet does not play a role in either the cause or the treatment of acne. However, what is best for your body is best for your skin. So make sure you get enough vitamins, minerals and supplements that have been known and recommended to prevent and help conquer acne breakouts. These include * Vitamin A or Retinol (High doses are toxic) * Vitamin B Complex * Vitamin C * Vitamin E * L-Carnitine * Zinc A good quality brand name multivitamin will probably have the recommended vitamins and minerals that you need to help with acne prevention. Drinking plenty of fluids throughout the day and making good, healthy dietary food choices. 3. Hormonal Treatment Hormones (or a lack of them) during later years - especially for women - can play a role in acne flare-ups and prevention. One recent study showed that about 50 percent of women have acne, referred to as hormonal acne, problems during the week before their menstruation. Treatment options include topical retinoids, oral antibiotics and Benzoyl Peroxide for teen years. For adults oral contraceptives or hormonal birth control pills and hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) may be helpful for women, combined with systemic or topical treatments, prescription or over-the-counter products and medications. 4. Healthy Skin Regimen Avoid harsh scrubbing or over-washing, because this can cause possible skin irritation or possible over production of oil to replace what's washed off, clogging pores in the process. Use products with gentle exfoliation ingredients and skip products that contain alcohol. 5. Acne Products Some of the more popular products on the market that can prevent acne include * Benzoyl Peroxide * Proactiv® Solution * Salicylic Acid * Retinoids * Antibiotics * Oral Contraceptives * Anti-Androgens * Isotretinoin (Accutane) 6. Shaving Shaving is actually an excellent way of exfoliating or removing dead skin to help with the prevention and spreading of acne instead of leaving the remains to clog pores. And for some light acne cases already in process, shaving can help rid whiteheads and blackheads from the face. Do not shave areas taht are sore or infected. Use a shaving cream for sensitive skin. Shave with a sharp blade. Use gentle swipes instead of heavy pressure and go with the flow or \"grain.\" A single-edged blade is better than a twin-blade razor. Electric razors may not shave as close to the skin, but they help with the prevention of acne and other skin breakouts and flare-ups better. 7. Stress Stress includes external and internal stressors. External Stressors are those that compromise your skin's ability to heal, like oily make-up and too much sun. Internal stressors like anxiety, fear, low self-esteem, depression and a variety of other internalized emotions, can trigger chemical reactions inside your body that can result in acne flare-ups and other skin irritations. To combat internal stressors and prevent acne problems, get plenty of rest and sleep. Try to maintain regular hours. Keep a check list of \"Things that Calm You\" handy for stressful times, like reading a book, resting, listening to music, taking a walk, going out for an ice cream cone, etc. "},{"title":" 8 Secrets on How to Remove Acne Scars ","word_count":508,"summary":" There are several ways on removing acne scars.

The appearance of acne starts during puberty when the body actively produces hormones that causes too much sebum in the skin. This skin stage may pass but it would definitely leave marks to haunt your appearance forever. Treating acne scars can be done through natural inexpensive ways and dermatological procedures that would probably cost a lot. However, acne scar treatment still depends on the mildness and severity of the scar. Below are some of the techniques on removing acne scars naturally 1.     Hydration is the key. It has been proven that water is one of the best natural methods on how to remove acne scars and prevent acne breakouts. Drinking at least 8 glasses of water or more helps your skin to shed those unwanted dead skin cells. 2.     A lot of people are recommending the use Vitamin E capsule for those scars. You might apply it topically to the affected area by pricking a spot in the capsule and apply the oil to the scar. Another option is to take it orally to have that cell renewal from the inside. 3.     Rosehip seed oil is also an effective remedy on how to remove acne scars. This is an anti-ageing and anti-wrinkling agent that helps the skin to regenerate. Massage it on the scar twice a day. 4.     Eating a balance diet may help in removing acne scars. The more nutritious foods you include in your meal, the faster the scar will heal. It helps in building the skin cells and gives a healthy skin glow as well. 5.

Aside from the natural ways of removing acne scars, there are also dermatological procedures that would definitely give you a much faster result. However, pregnancy and other health conditions may hinder your want to undergo these procedures. Here are some of the hi-tech methods on how to remove acne scars effectively. 6.     Nowadays, not only certified dermatologists do a dermabrasion but facial salons as well. Dermabrasion is the removal of the top skin layer using a machine that chafes off the skin. Once the skin heals, the top layer will then have a smoother and clearer appearance. 7.     Laser resurfacing is one of the most affordable anti-scar treatments available. It simply uses a high-energy light that would remove the fine scars and even prevent wrinkles. 8.     You may also have a chemical peel procedure. This is just like dermabrasion. The only difference is that the top layer of the skin is peeled off using chemicals not machines. This is not a very advisable procedure for all since some people may have allergic reactions to the chemicals. With all the available choices for treatment, you surely would not have an excuse as to why your acne scar is still obvious. It’s your choice whether you would opt for the natural way or the dermatological procedure on how to remove acne scars.

We often want our skin to look young and healthy and we really do something just to protect our skin from whatever possible harms there may be in our environment.  This article explains you the top tips for healthy skin. ","keywords":" Skin care,Skin treatment,Acne,Mole,Warts,Skin problems,Skin,Acne treatment,Skin products,Healthy skin ","article_body":" Tip 1 Drink Water Water has long been considered as the most efficient natural treatment or an almost free treatment for any skin condition because of its being alkaline, with pH 7.3.  It prevents dehydration which is capable of producing sebum or oil from the sebaceous glands.  Your skin needs water in order for it to function best, thus doctors and nutritionists suggest that a daily intake of between 6 to 8 glasses of water per day is highly needed. Tip 2 Watch Your Diet Nutrition plays a vital role in skin health too.  Specific foods such as those acidic foods and dairy products are said to be effective in causing an allergic reaction in some people.  Also, one of the widely debated topics in the area of nutrition today is chocolates.   Some say that chocolate does affect the condition of the skin, while others say it doesn’t.  Whatever the result may be, the best advice is just to follow a nutritious diet that has a number of fresh fruits and green-leafy veggies, as well as fiber. Tip 3  Consider Exfoliants Many experts say that exfoliating your skin is another great way to attain a beautiful skin.  So, try to invest in a good body exfoliant or “loofah”, as it is commonly called, as it is capable of eliminating the dead skin cells from your body.   Accordingly, this should be done once or twice a week so to free the skin to breathe.   What’s more, exfoliants help to put off ingrown hair from developing. However, it is essential to avoid using any body exfoliant on the skin on the face.   The main reason for this precaution is that the facial tissue is more sensitive and finer than those tissues of the body. Tip 4 Consider a Healthy Routine for Facial Care When it comes to facial skin care, getting into a healthy beauty routine is not bad.  Most of the doctors today greatly suggest that you cleanse, moisturize and tone your skin twice every day.   When cleaning, never fail to remember cleaning the area on the neck, including your face.  Apply a moisturizer or neck cream after. Before going to bed at night, always bear in mind to remove all make up. Clean your skin before you sleep, no matter how tired you may feel.   It was found out that during the night, the skin goes through a process of elimination and cannot breathe properly if it is clogged with make up.  And, you may also find out that sleeping with your make up on will cause your skin to “break out” with spots on it. When it comes to shaving for men, some men may experience shaving rashes.  For many, these rashes lower their self-esteem, but this is actually not a big problem to think about.  There are a lot ways to avoid rashes.  Perhaps one of the best is to make sure that when shaving, the razor strokes are following the direction of hair growth.  That’s simply it! Tip 5 Heal Your Feet When it comes to skin care, the feet are often neglected.  So, if care you found no time for a professional pedicure, try to fill a football or basin with warm water and add your favorite essential oil. Soak your feet for about fifteen minutes.  Then, dry them and apply a rough skin remover onto them.   Rinse this off and dry you feet well.   And, if you consider pedicure, simply add some body cream to your feet for an easy and quick fix pedicure. Tip 6 Avoid Too Much Exposure to the Sun One of the most common precautions when it comes to skin care is avoiding too much exposure to the sun.  As you may know, over exposure to sunlight causes sunburn.  So, while current sun blocks only block out the UVB rays and still let in harmful UVA rays, it is still wise to cover up before venturing into the hands of Apollo.   If possible, use a wide brimmed hat while tending your garden to keep the sun from your face. Tip 7  Exercise Aside from considering a healthy diet, exercising your body also helps keep your skin healthy.  Note that a proper exercise does not only keep the body fit by regulating the oxygen; it also improves the glow of the skin as well. Tip 8  Take Enough Rest One common problem that face people is stress; the one which is not normal.   It was found out that when a person is stressed, the adrenal cortex converts adrenal androgens to the hormone testosterone in male and female, which in turn results in overactive sebaceous glands.   These adrenal androgens are released causing a double amount of testosterone, causing the face to be oily, while other areas of the body are still dry from dehydration.  So, taking proper rest that includes 6 to 8 hours of undisturbed sleep daily is the best way to rejuvenate the skin.

Stress creates hormones that actually age us as they destroy cells and create toxic biproducts and free radicals. Studies have shown that prayer and meditation can reduce our stress levels. Prayer and meditation have been proven to even alleviate some of the symptoms of cancer and other life threatening diseases. 2) Drink plenty of water. It is a fact that 90% of us do not drink enough water. For your skin cells to function properly and heal properly from cuts, etc... we need to drink 8-12 glasses of water every day. Our skin is one of our most important organs as it protects us from disease, cushions our falls, etc... It needs plenty of water. 3) Get proper sleep. Not getting the proper 8-10 hours of sleep per day will first show in your skin. Broken capillaries, puffiness, circles under the eyes. 4) Eat well. Get proper nutrition. Too many junk foods can cause or worsen skin problems like pimples and acne. A well balanced meal 3 times per day has been proven to help alleviate spikes in skin problems and help to average out the outbreaks in acne vulgaris. 5) Take vitamins to supplement your skin and body. We can't always make sure we get 100% of each vitamin and mineral with the foods we eat, but we can take a multivitamin once a day. They are cheap at Walmart and there is no excuse. People that take multivitamins once a day live longer. Its a proven fact just like persons that smoke take years off their lives. 6) Properly clean your skin. Harsh soaps can dry out your skin and even stimulate further sebum (oil) production which can worsen acne. Use a mild cleanser with 2% salicylic acid. This has been proven very effective in ridding excess oils while maintaining proper hydration and pH. The slight acidity will keep bacteria at bay. 7) Don't smoke. Smoking puts years on you. Literally, smoking can add 10 years to the aged look of your skin. Why would you want to do that? If you must have nicotine then get nicotine gum or the patch - they will cure your cravings and there is no evidence or statistics of anyone developing cancer, lung disease, etc... from these. 8) Wear sunscreen. The skin does have keratonin to protect against the suns rays, but it is no match for UV rays, etc... that we expose ourselves to. Melanoma has several forms and all are deadly. If you don't think you will get skin cancer or think you are invulnerable, just go to your local dermatologist and ask to see pictures of clients with skin cancer, better yet go to the oncology center at your local hospital. You won't think that way ever again. Wear sunscreen. 9) Treat yourself to a spa treatment atleast once a year. Skin peels, TCA peels, deep tissue massage, complete relaxation, aromatherapy, etc... will all energize and heal your skin. TCA peels will actual improve your skins ability to regenerate itself and improve collagen levels. Remember, follow these nine steps to enjoy healthier skin.

","keywords":" acne,acne help,acne tips,acne info,acne treatments,get rid of acne,acne home remedy,adult acne,acne care,acne solutions,skin acne care ","article_body":" Are you looking for acne solutions that really work? The good news is, whether you're a teenager or an adult suffering from acne, you don't have to live with it. Here you can find 10 super easy and effective ways to get rid of acne. 1. Do not pick, press or rub your pimples. These actions actually increase the sebum production and rupture the membranes below your skin. The infection and sebum will spread underneath your skin and cause more pimples. Also, you risk increasing the chances of leaving scars on your face. 2. Wash your face twice a day using a mild soup. It is even better if you can buy sulfur-based soap especially for acne. If your skin is too oily, use a soap with benzoyl peroxide. Do not use rough sponges, brushes, or anything similar on your face. You shouldn't, however, over-wash your face because it will actually stimulate your sebaceous glands to produce more sebum which will increase your acne. 3. Check if it is because of the food. For many people, food allergy can cause very serious acne condition. You should avoid eating too much oily and spicy food. Recent studies have shown that acne can also be caused by milk which contains hormones as well as seafood with relatively high levels of iodine. If possible, cut down on those foods. Other foods you may consider avoiding are sugar, dairy products, deep-fried food, meat, nut butters, etc. On the other hand, it is believed that green vegetables, vegetable fuices and foods rich in zinc can help alleviate acne condition. 4. Drink more water every day. \"Eight glasses of water a day can keep acne away.\" says Jennifer Thoden, a respected acne expert. The reason is that water can carry waste material out of our body and it really helps heal and prevent acne flare-ups. 5. Do not wear makeup if possible. Makeup products can clog your pores, cause more blackheads and pimples. If you have to wear makeup, make sure it is water-based. Be sure to clean your makeup brushes regularly and cleanse your skin before you sleep. 6. Do not use oily products. Avoid products such as hair pomades, intense oil-based facial moisturizers, and oily cleansers. 7. Keep your face clean. Do not rest your chin on your hands or constantly touch your face. Regular shampoo your hair and keep it off your face, especially when you sleep. 8. Exercise moderately as it helps in blood circulation and eliminataion of toxins. 9. Stay stress-free. Studies have shown that stress not only worsens acne flare-up, it also worsens the overall skin condition. Talk to your friends, listen to your favorite music, or take a walk in the park. There are many things you can do to be stree free. 10. Get Sunshine and fresh air. Sunshine stimulates vitamin D in the body, an essential vitamin for healthy skin. Fresh air and sunshine can also reduce stress (tip #9) and increase oxygen to the skin. Don't get burnt in the sun though. Burnt and heavily tanned skin forms a layer on the skin that doesn't exfoliate quickly enough and can lead to blocked pores.

It can appear as pimples, blackheads, pustules or in severe cases it would look like an acne cyst. This commonly appears during puberty when the sebaceous gland starts to function aggressively. Male, female, teenagers or adult, back acne does not have a particular range of age nor gender and practically can affect anybody. Below are some ways to treat bacne. 1.     Wear cool clothes and put some powder at your back to prevent perspiration. This is a vital way on how to cure back acne. Change clothes if you have perspired too much on it to prevent further back acne build up. 2.     After doing a vigorous activity, you would probably give off too much sweat. Take a shower immediately or if not possible, wipe your perspiration using towels with soft fabric such as cotton. 3.     Pat dry you skin after taking a shower. Do not rub the towel. It might irritate your skin and cause inflammation on your back acne. 4.     If your back acne is not yet severe, you may still use anti-bacterial cleansers that are designed for facial acne. Nowadays, there are also anti-acne soaps that can be used not just for the face but for body as well. Avoid using regular soap. These soaps may not meet the demands that your sensitive skin needs. 5.     Avoid carrying back packs until your back acne clears up. This would prevent your back from heating up which results to more perspiration and breeding ground for bacteria that causes back acne. 6.     One of the best ways on how to cure back acne properly is to use gels or creams containing at least 10 percent benzoyl peroxide. They can be bought at drugstores even without any prescriptions from a dermatologist (skin doctor). 7.     Studies show that benzoyl peroxide works better when used with products having alpha-hydroxy. This will heal and dry up back acne two times faster. 8.     Some people also have natural techniques on how to cure back acne. One home remedy for treating back acne is to use homemade Sodium Hydrixide (Lye) soap while adding some tea tree oil in it. This does not dry and heal acne faster but would definitely give you a softer skin. 9.     Exfoliate once a week. If you don’t want to spend money on buying expensive body scrubs, you may use sugar instead to take off all those dead skin cells. Do it on the affected area such as back and buttocks. 10.     You may seek professional help in case of very severe back acne. Theirs is nothing to be ashamed about. Dermatologists are willing to help people suffering this kind of skin problem. They would probably recommend medicines that needs prescription, antibiotics that should be taken orally, topical treatments, retinol or even oral contraceptives (for female only). So there you go.

Each year new acne treatments hit the market, each claiming to stop further acne breakouts.  Yet no one medication for acne has been proven to do that. If you're like so many acne sufferers, and have a medicine cabinet full of various acne medications that don't work, you need to stop and get back to the basics of acne care.  Your first step is to become knowledgeable about what acne is and how it develops.  Visit your doctor, or better yet consult with a dermatologist about your acne condition. Your dermatologist may recommend over-the-counter medications for acne or if your acne is severe, you may need perscription acne medication. Much of the medications for acne available today consist of several products (systems for controlling acne), which includes an acne face wash, exfolliator or toner and some lotion.  The combined use of these acne medications can have dramatic results in acne blemish control.  Though they will likely not cure your acne, they will, when used properly, significantly lessen the number of acne breakouts. These acne blemish control systems include Face wash or cleanser The face wash or cleanser is used to fight bacteria.  Some are designed to combat bacteria, both on the surface and within the pores.  At the same time many contain tiny granules to help exfoliate dead skin cells and impurities. The two most common ingredients of face washes is either benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. Each of these ingredients approach acne control in different ways. Benzoyl Peroxide Benzoyl peroxide used as an antiseptic to lessen the number of surface bacteria and skin yeasts.  It is available as a gel, cream, lotion or face wash in varying concentrations. Salicylic Acid Salicylic acid helps to slow down shedding skin cells inside the follicle, which in turn reducing clogging.  It also helps breakdown, both blackheads and white heads.  Salicylic acid is available in varying forms, like gels, lotions and medicated pads (Stridex) and in varying concentrations. Exfolliator or toner The purpose of this gel or cream is to remove dead skin cells, unclog pores and remove excess oil. This one step is essential to acne blemish control.  While not visible to the naked eye, clogging of the pores are a major contributor to acne breakouts. Again, depending on the manufacturer, either benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid or another medication for acne may be included in this step. Lotion The final step is applying a lotion. These lotions are usually oil free and used to moisturerize, re-hydrate and reduce irritation of your skin.  Some lotions may contain benzoyl peroxide to heal inflammation, which helps prevent future breakouts. No matter which medication for acne you choose to use, following the acne treatment listed above will help to lessen your acne breakouts.  Each step is an important step in active acne blemish control.  The combined use of these medications can help to keep your skin clear and acne free.

Your baby receives these hormones from the placenta, after the delivery. Don't worry if your baby has pimples. About 20% of the newborn babies are affected by baby acne, also known as acne-neonatorum. Let’ know the various aspects of this peculiar type of acne. First things first, the treatment for infantile acne is not the same as that of acne treatment for any other age group. Infantile acne is gender-biased. Male babies are more affected than their female counterparts. Normally babies have the acne attack at the age of 3 weeks. Some babies have it from the time of delivery. Generally the types of acne you find in infants are papules and pustules. Papules are red bumps and pustules are whiteheads. They have a collection of pus. Some babies also have acne on the scalp. Acne in babies does not require treatment as such. The lesions will take care of themselves within a period of four months. But do take the normal care of the baby as you would take care of its other body parts. Use mild baby soap and gently clean the face once in a day with water. Do not try harsher methods by using oil and other lotions which you think are good. They may at times, worsen the condition. Know for certain that infantile acne will disappear when it has to. In your anxiety to photograph the baby, don't stuff his/her cheeks with cosmetics and if at all you need to have the touch-ups, do it in an imaginative way. If you or your family doctor feel that the baby has severe acne, treat it with benzoyl peroxide, keratolytic agents or topical creams like retinoids. The ways of acne are indeed mysterious. If you have a family history of acne, that doesn't mean that your baby will have acne. And just because the baby has acne, it doesn't mean that, it will suffer from the attack of acne, when it grows up. Acne has its own working style and attacking strategy. Infantile acne, which normally appears after the age of three months in a baby, quietly disappears after the age of 12 months. No special efforts of treatment are required. In some babies, the condition may last up to three years. It is due to the genetic makeup of your baby. You have something to contribute to it, as the hereditary part. You have nothing to do with the infantile acne, relating to the treatment part. Just observe its arrival and departure. Well, arrival with anxiety and departure with pleasure!

Therefore, acne skin care must be targeted at keeping the skin clean and reducing its oiliness. Individuals with acne should wash their faces with warm water and soap or face wash that is specially manufactured for acne-prone skin. Products containing tea tree oil are supposed to be beneficial.

Astringent can be used to cleanse and tone the skin, followed by the application of a mild, water-based moisturizer. Pimples should not be touched frequently or squeezed, as this often aggravates the problem and leaves behind stubborn marks. Tomato, mint, or cucumber juice can be applied on the face and the neck. They provide a blemish-free complexion. In addition, a weekly face mask made of almond powder, milk, and rosewater can prevent pimples and lead to glowing skin. Oil-based make up should not be used on acne-prone skin. Although a variety of concealers are available in the market to hide skin blemishes, they offer only a temporary solution. In fact, some concealers add to acne problems. Apart from following a skin care regimen based on suitable products, diet needs to be controlled to prevent or cure acne. This is because acne also results from digestive disorders. Intake of fried food, sweets, tea, coffee, soft drinks, and alcohol should be cut down.

When the sebaceous glands become clogged with the oily substance they create, the accumulation results in pimples. There are several forms of acne, but the most common is acne vulgaris, found primarily in adolescents. The exact cause of acne is not known, but factors that contribute to this condition include heredity, oily skin and androgens. Additional factors include allergies, stress, the use of certain drugs, nutritional deficiencies, liver dysfunction, exposure to industrial pollutants, cosmetics and the monthly menstrual cycle. In addition, the skin functions to eliminate a portion of the body's toxic waste by sweating. If the body contains more toxins than the kidneys or liver can effectively discharge, the skin takes over. In fact, some doctors call the skin the 3rd kidney. As toxins escape through the skin, they can disrupt the health and integrity of the skin, creating issues. <B>Recommendations for Wellness</B> Note Some of these recommendations may take 2-4 weeks before any results or improvements are experienced. Apply distilled white vinegar (can be diluted if too strong) to the face and affected areas. Allow this to sit for 5-10 minutes before rinsing off with cool water. Lemon or any citric fruit works great as a natural exfoliate, removing dead skin cells that may clog the pours. As with the white vinegar, apply the juice of a lemon (or desired citric juice) to the face. Allow it to dry for about 10 minutes, then rinse with cool water. You may feel a mild sting or burn when the lemon juice is applied. If so, diluting the juice is acceptable. Increase water consumption. Water helps flush toxin out and help transport nutrients in the body. Eat a properly balanced diet to ensure proper nutrition. Take a high quality multiple vitamin and mineral supplement to make up for nutrients missing in today's foods. Echinacea or Oregon grape can be used to boost the immune system and fight acne-causing bacteria. Dandelion, Burdock or red clover can help to keep the liver clear of toxic overload. Herbal combinations such as Natures Sunshine’s Ayurvedic Skin Detox, and BP-X can also be used to cleanse and detoxify the liver and reduce acne. Large quantities of vitamin A have been successfully used to treat severe acne. Large amounts, however, can be toxic and should only be used when working with your health care provider.

If having acne is considered bad, then what about having acne scars for several years more ? If acne scars are what you want to either avoid or get rid of, then a few tips are presented here ... <b>Prevention is better than cure </b> If you are still in the early stages of acne then you might want to consult a qualified dermatologist at the earliest to prevent acne from getting worse. Getting rid of acne fast can greatly reduce the chances of scarring later on. A qualified dermatologist can help determine your skin type and the particular triggers that may exacerbate your acne help you get rid of acne fast. What if you already have scars? Well, if your acne has already progressed beyond the initial stage of whiteheads and blackheads and you now have pimples and scars on your face, then you have to do two things at the same time - get rid of pimples and get rid of acne scars. Before discussing how to eliminate acne scars, you may want to know... <b>What are acne scars?</b> Acne scars are caused when pimples either get inflamed or do not heal fully. Acne scars are formed when at least one of the layers of healthy skin is injured. When the skin is damaged and bleeding, the body forms new tissue fibers at the place to heal the wound and stop the bleeding. It is these tissues that may appear as a scar. So getting rid of scars requires that the scar tissue be replaced by healthy tissue by some process or method. Becoming completely free of acne scars that already have been formed depends on two things  1) The severity of the scarring and  2) the treatment method you follow. The more severe the scarring, the more effort and time it may require before the scar can completely heal. <b>Treatment methods for acne scars</b> There are several methods to heal acne scars but in practice very few of them may be very effective. And some methods may have side effects that you may want to be aware of before you start such a program. Laser Resurfacing A carbon dioxide laser burns away the damaged skin, layer by layer. The depth of penetration is controlled. As the outer layers of damaged skin is removed, new skin cells begin to form as the healing process starts and in a few weeks, a younger looking smoother skin surface begins to appear. This is how the process is supposed to work, at least in theory. Laser resurfacing is a relatively new process and you might want to ask your dermatologist about the effectiveness of this method in healing acne scars. <b>Dermabrasion</b> This uses a spinning diamond instrument or a rotating wire brush to wear down the outer layers of the skin that have been damaged. And when the skin starts healing, younger and smoother skin will replace the old skin removed by abrasion. The healing process may take up to 3 weeks. <b>Chemical peels for acne scars</b> Acidic solutions are applied to the skin to peel away the damaged layers and the new skin that is formed is usually smoother. Chemical peels range from mild to deep penetration. Though chemical peels can be applied at home, it would be advisable to get a dermatologist to apply it. <b>Punch grafts</b> More suitable for deep and pitted acne scars, this method involves punching a hole to remove the scar and then removing a small piece of undamaged skin - usually from the area behind the ear - and using it to replace the damaged skin. There are treatments for acne scars. But the question you may want to ask is... <b>Do They Work?</b> All of the treatments mentioned above seem to have a moderate success rate - while they seem to work well for others, some are less than delighted with these treatments. While results like these may be expected with any medical procedure, your face is a very important part of your life and you will want to be absolutely certain that any treatment will be beneficial to your sense of well-being and not otherwise.

While they are not magicians who can make your acne disappear overnight, they can be essential in diagnosing and treating you so that you don’t have to suffer any longer than necessary. It is important to remember a few things when visiting a skin care specialist. Because there are so many people in the world that suffer from acne outbreaks, dermatologists are often very busy with lots of clients. Don’t let this vex you; a doctor is concerned about your condition and wants to help you. Here are some things that you can do to maximize your visit when you see them. Having effective doctor visits will help you overcome your acne sooner and also help you save money and time. First, don’t be afraid to ask questions about your condition. Remember, we are all different, so a treatment that is highly effective with one person is not necessarily what is going to work for you. Knowledge about the particulars of your condition will help you better understand the condition you are trying to overcome. You may even want to write down any specific questions you may have to make sure you cover all the topics you want to know about. The most important aspect of having an effective doctor visit is good communication. By keeping some facts or aspects about your condition from the dermatologist, you are only hurting yourself by giving them an incomplete knowledge of the facts. The doctor can only base his diagnosis on what you have told him, so try to be thorough with the details about your acne. Tell them how long your acne has been affecting you, what other treatments you’ve attempted to do before, what worsens your condition, and any other factors that you think may apply. Tell them how your acne is affecting you emotionally and socially, as mental health is synonymous with your physical health. Once your doctor and you have discussed your condition, make sure that you fully understand what they will be doing in regards to your treatment. Be sure to understand the correct way to apply the treatment, how long the treatment will last, and how long it will be before you begin to see results. Also, be sure and find out if there are any side effects that go along with the use of the treatment; this will help you be better prepared for any occurrences or problems that may arise. Schedule a follow-up appointment with the doctor and discuss what the status of your condition should be when you return. If you are knowledgeable about the treatment and looking for the desired results, you will know sooner whether your current method is working or not. Remember that there are many treatments available that work better or worse for different people. Don’t be discouraged if the first method you try does not attain the desired results.

Some of the characteristics of acne include black heads, pimples, cysts, infected abscesses, and rarely scarring. Acne usually occurs during adolescence in both men and women. To be more specific, acne starts during puberty and tends to get worse for people with oily skin. Acne badly affects teenage boys. Only mild to moderate forms of acne occur in middle-aged women. Acne can be seen most commonly on the face. The other places where it can occur include the neck, chest, back, shoulders, scalp, and upper arms and legs. Most forms of acne are the result of heredity and hormonal problems and has nothing to do with a harmful diet or poor hygiene. Types of acne Acne starts in a similar way for all but can take different forms and can react in a unique way according to the body conditions of the individual. A basic lesion called the comedo is the begining of acne. The comedo is an enlarged hair follicle plugged with oil and bacteria residing under the surface of your skin, that waits for the right conditions to grow into an inflamed lesion. Whenever the skin produces more oil, the bacteria grows within the swollen follicle. The surrounding skin becomes increasingly inflamed as your white blood cells fight against the intruders. Two main types of acne include non-inflammatory acne and inflammatory acne. Non-inflammatory acne Closed comedo If the plugged follicle stays below the surface of the skin, the lesion is called a closed comedo. This usually appears on the skin as small, whitish bumps. This condition is otherwise called as whitehead. Open comedo If the plug enlarges and pushes through the surface of the skin, the lesion is called an open comedo. The dark appearance of the plug is not due to dirt, but due to the buildup of melanin, the pigmentation element of the skin. This condition is otherwise called as blackhead. Inflammatory acne Papule This appears on the skin as a small, firm pink bump. The papules are tender in nature and are often considered an intermediary step between non-inflammatory and clearly inflammatory lesions. Pustule These are small round lesions that are inflamed and contain visible pus, which appear red at the base with a yellowish or whitish center. Pustules do not contain a large amount of bacteria. The inflammation is caused by chemical irritation from sebum components such as fatty free acids. Cyst These are large pus-filled lesions that are usually present deep within the skin. The cysts are very painful lesions, as they are inflamed. Cysts form as a result of the contents of a comedo spilling over the surrounding skin and due to the response of the local immune system in producing pus. The cysts often leave deep scars. Acne conglobata This is a rare but serious form of inflammatory acne that develops primarily on the back, buttocks, and chest. In addition, to the presence of pustules and cysts, there may be severe bacterial infection. Symptoms The common symptoms of acne include persistent, recurrent red spots or swellings on the skin known as pimples. The pimples become inflamed and get filled with pus. The pimples usually occur on the face, chest, shoulders, neck, or upper portion of the back. Some of the other symptoms include dark spots with open pores at the center, which are known as blackheads, bulged spots under the skin without openings, which are known as whiteheads, and red swellings or lumps filled with pus, which are known as pustules. The pustules can develop from blackheads or whiteheads. Inflamed fluid-filled lumps under the skin known as cysts are also a symptom of acne. These cysts can become as large as an inch across.

Acne mostly affects young people in the age 14 - 25, but also sometimes older persons, like women in their menopause. Most teenagers experience outburst of acne, some only little, but for others acne may develop into a serious skin ailment with great cosmetic impact. THE SKIN ANATOMY To understand the acne process, some knowledge about skin anatomy and physiology is essential The skin has there layers The outer layer called epidermis consists of epithelial cells. Under this lies the dermis consisting of connective tissue. At the bottom there is a layer called the hypodermis consisting mostly of fat cells. The skin has narrow pores extending from the surface down to the top of the sub-dermis, called hair follicles. A hair extend from a growth zone in the bottom of each hair follicle and out at the skin surface. Around the hair in the dermis, there are small glands called sebaceous glands. These glands produce a fatty substance, sebum, which empty through the follicle opening and lubricates the hair and the skin. THE ACNE PROCESS Acne starts by the glands in the hair follicles increasing their sebum production. This will in the beginning only cause greasy skin. Eventually the sebum in the entrance of the follicles mixes with dead epithelial cells. This mix reacts chemically to forms hard props, comedones that close the pore entrances. According to the color of the comedones, they are called black heads or white heads. Then the closed hair follicle gets filled with sebum and swell. The swollen follicle then gets infected by bacteria. The bacteria and the accumulated sebum cause the follicle and the surrounding skin to get inflamed, forming a pimple.  At last the inflamed follicle burst and empties its content.  Eventually the affected area heals. Sometimes the inflammation reaches deep into the skin surrounding the follicle and destroys skin tissue. This will cause more or less distinct scars that may reside permanently. Typically an affected person will have follicles in all these stages of the process at any given time. THE CAUSES OF ACNE The increased hormone production in the puberty stimulates to increased sebum production. The male hormone, testosterone, seem to contribute most. Also girls begin to produce more testosterone in the puberty. Also in other periods, altered hormone production may give acne, for example by women in the menopause. Since not all teens get acne in any degree, the increased hormone level cannot be the whole cause of the increased sebum production. The follicles of affected persons must for some reason react stronger upon the higher hormone level. Dietary factors, like eating too much fat, too much sugar or the wrong kind of fat may aggravate acne by some individuals. Lack of vitamins, minerals and essential fatty acids may also contribute to development of acne. Poor digestion, lazy colon and constipation aggravate acne in some individuals, probably due to productions of toxins in the intestines. Lazy colon may be caused by dietary faults, like lack of fiber. Very frequent washing and use of strong soaps aggravate acne, and does not alleviate the condition as many think. Rubbing, scrubbing or squeezing the skin may also aggravate acne. Here are some other factors that may contribute in causing acne or aggravating the condition. - Stress - Some contraceptive agents - Environmental or domestic pollution. - Humid environments. - Some antidepressants. - Testosterone and anabolic steroids used for treatment or by body-building. - Use of some types of greasy cosmetic products. - Some antiperspirant products. - Exposing the skin for chlorine or other halogens, or medicines containing halogens. - Women may get aggravated acne 2-7 days before menstruation.

Using only soy oil will give you too much of some fatty acids and too less of others. - Eat much fish, seafood and not so much meat. - Eat food with a high fiber content to regulate the digestion, like vegetables, whole cereals, full corn bread and fruit. 2. Here are some things you should avoid. - Do not use greasy or heavy cosmetics that clog your skin and are difficult to wash away. - Do not use strong irritating antiperspirants. - Do not wash with strong soap or cleaners that dry up your skin and take away all the natural oily protection in your skin. - If you perform body-building, do not use anabolic steroids or other hormonal supplements. - Use clothes that allow air to reach your body surface to avoid collection of humidity and overheating of your skin. 3.

Adults in their twenties, all the way up to their fifties can still experience acne flare-ups.  And adult acne can have just as many negative effects on a person as teenage acne.  Possibly even more so, as the stress of career and family adds to the strain of living with an unsightly skin problem. Mental stress can be one of the major causes of acne in adults.  It is not a surprise in the slightest that women are often more likely to suffer from adult acne than men, as it has been shown that women have much more stress in their day to day lifestyle, not to mention that they are prone to hormonal imbalances, especially during times such as their menstrual cycle and pregnancy.  Just as in teens, hormones play an important factor in the onset and exacerbation of adult acne. The environmental factors that surround a person, paired with the individual's lifestyle can also play a huge role in the appearance of adult acne.  An improper diet or behaviors such as smoking and drinking affect the skin's condition and resistance to acne, as well as other diseases. Prevention is the only obvious way to go when dealing with adult acne. A proper diet, paired with plenty of water and rest is a good start.  Trying to relieve stress and maintaining proper skin care and hygiene can also help to prevent acne from occurring. But what about the pimples that you may already have?

Acne maybe the scourge of adolescent years, but it can follow people into middle age and beyond. Acne is really a catchall term for a variety of symptoms such as pimples, whiteheads, and blackheads. It's a condition where the pores of skin become clogged and the person gets inflamed and non-inflamed lesions. So what's the cause of all the clogging ?...... Heredity - at least for the most part. Acne is genetic - it tends to run in families, it is an inherited defect of your pores. If both your parents had acne, three out of four of your brothers and sisters will get it too. Factors that can aggravate an acne outbreak are - Stress, sun exposure, seasonal changes, and climate can all precipitate an acne attack. Certain types of makeup and taking birth control pills can also cause a breakout. Change Your Make-up In adult women, make-up is the major factor in acne outbreaks, especially oil based products. It's the oil that causes the problem. The oil is usually a derivative of fatty acids that are more potent than your own fatty acids. Use a non-oil-based make-up if you are prone to acne. Read The labels. Cosmetic products that contain lanolins, isopropyl myristate, sodium lauryl sulphate, laureth-4 and D & C red dyes should be avoided. Like oil, these ingredients are too rich for the skin. Wash Properly. Wash your make-up off thoroughly every night. Use a mild soap twice a day and make sure you rinse the soap entirely off your face. Rinse six or seven times with fresh water. Use Less Make-up. Whatever make-up you use, try to cut down on the amount you put on. Leave Well Alone. Don't squeeze pimples or whiteheads. A pimple is an inflammation, and you could add to the inflammation by squeezing it, which could lead to an infection. A pimple will always go away in one to four weeks if you leave them alone. Know When To Squeeze. Most pimples are best left alone, but there is one kind that you can squeeze to help get rid of it. If the pimple has a little central yellow pus head in it, then a gentle squeeze will make it pop open very nicely. Once the pus pops out, the pimple will heal more quickly. Attack Blackheads. You can also get rid of blackheads by squeezing them. A blackhead is a very blocked pore, and a gentle squeeze will help rectifty this. Give Dry Skin Extra Care. Dry skin can be sensitive to some over the counter skin treatments, so please use these treatments with care. Start with the lower strength products first, and then increase the concentration slowly. Stay Out Of The Sun. Acne medications may cause adverse reactions to the sun, so minimize you exposure until you know what the reactions going to be. Use One Treatment At A Time. Don't mix treatments, use only one at a time because they may cause an adverse reaction if mixed together. Stop The Spread Of Acne. Apply acne medication about half an inch around the affected area, to help keep the acne from spreading. Acne moves across the face from the nose to the ear, so you need to treat beyond the inflamed area. Most people make the mistake of treating only the pimples and not the outlaying areas of skin. This is wrong. If you are an acne sufferer, then I trust this information will be very helpful to you.

Where in the world do they come from? Common acne is officially known as acne vulgaris.  This blemish producing blight is caused by multiple factors.  During puberty the body produces an excess of the male hormone testosterone.  Also, female menstrual cycles cause changes in the body that throw the hormone balance a bit out of whack.  Add to this the other changes in the adolescent body that begins the process of turning them into adults, and acne is on its way.  Much of the problems caused by acne come from the bacteria that is normally present on skin, a staff like bacteria that grows in abundance, especially in clogged pores filled with dead skin cells. Other things can cause acne as well, or make it worse.  Exposure to too much chlorine can cause a long lasting and nasty type of acne, and use of anabolic steroids can cause acne, in addition to many other health problems that they can cause. For many years people thought that acne was caused by poor hygiene, and kids would scrub their faces raw in an effort to open up pores and get rid of pimples and blackheads.  That actually may make the problem worse by damaging the skin.  Also for many years people thought that certain foods would make some people more prone to acne.  Fried foods were blamed, as was chocolate.  This may have been a natural assumption.  Teenagers often eat candy bars and other chocolate foods.  Also teenagers tend to be fans of fried foods, such as hamburgers, French fries, tator tots, fish and chips, and fried chicken.  Many people associated oily skin with greasy foods, but there is no medical or scientific connection.  Acne is a nasty, but natural part of growing up. Most people outgrow acne as their bodies change and puberty ends.  In fact, by the time most people reach their twenties they are through with the ravages of acne.  For a few people it may hang on longer, but for the vast majority of people it is a temporary and passing thing.  Time will cure most cases as a person passes into adulthood. The types of acne blemishes are divided into two different categories, inflamed and non-inflamed.  Non-inflamed blemishes are called blackheads or whiteheads.  The whitehead is a clogged follicle that plugs the skin pore.  The mass is made up of dead skin cells.  The blackhead is in essence the same thing, but it has opened up and become oxidized, creating the darker tint.  Many people think that blackheads come from dirt, but that is not the case. Inflamed blemishes are those that are commonly call pimples or zits.  These blemishes are usually reddish and look inflamed.  The red pimple is classic.  A bit more troublesome is the larger cyst.  Pimples develop when a whitehead does not turn into a blackhead and plugs the pore so that it can be expelled.  Instead the pore wall breaks down and becomes a repository for oil, dead skin cells, bacteria and other debris of the body.  White blood cells congregate in the blemish to fight the infection, and form a puss substance, that can become painful.  Everyone is familiar with pimples.  The larger cyst can be even more painful, and it can flair up again and again and may require medical attention. There are many misconceptions about acne.  Some people think that the sun will cure acne and seek a suntan as a cure all.  However, this has no positive effect, simply darkening the skin just makes pimples harder to see, and the side effects can be wrinkles and skin cancer in later life.  However, there are many treatments available for acne that can lessen the impact it has on the lives of the victims.  Many good over the counter remedies, natural remedies, and when needed prescription, drugs can help.

You see something odd on your forehead, that wasn't there the previous night when you went to bed. It looks ugly and you wish it would go away. The What That ugly thing that pops up on our face when we least expect turning our world upside down is what an acne is. Also known as pimples, these are outburst through our skin pores thanks to all the grime and dirt that has accumulated there. It typically occurs during the adolescent phase in a person, say, during their teenage years. And some are lucky, they don't get acnes at all, while others see clusters of them on their face. It is not something that only girls get, there are boys who suffer from this as well. If you are lucky, it will last couple of days, and then disappear never to reappear again, but the unfortunate ones see signs of acne through their life, some of which leave behind scars. The Why The most common kind of acne is the acne vulgaris which translates to common acne. The face is the region of the face that is affected in almost 90% of the cases, at times, people get it on their forearms or chest region. But those are called Keratosis, and not acne, since they are bigger in size and last longer than a common acne. It is basically eruptions in our skin due to dirt and other particles settling in. if the acne is very severe, and looks like a big boil, it could be a cyst, in which case one needs to be careful and not touch it too much. If they do, it might erupt, ooze with puss and not be a pretty sight. The How For some, acne is such a big problem, that they think of skipping school or college. They don't want to face their friends for fear of being ridiculed. For some girls, hormonal changes in their body leads to acne, and for this there is no cure but to let nature takes it course. There is no need to panic or worry about these little boils,.as they are our body reacting to changes happening inside. If it is due to bad eating habits, or intake of oily foods on a regular basis, acne or pimples occur when the follicles are blocked and does not get enough oxygen. If you were to touch an acne and then use those fingers on other parts of your face, you might spread the infection and see more tiny pimples occurring over the next few days. So, it is better to control yourself and keep your hands away from your face and wash your face multiple times during the day. In the market, there are various products that claim to make the acne go away in a day or two, but be warned that they are miracles and not likely to disappear.

This condition is very common in puberty. As one reaches their early twenties, it either disappears or decreases. Acne begins because of the comedo, an enlarged hair follicle plugged with oil and bacteria. The comedo is invisible to the naked eye and is present beneath the surface of the skin. When it gets the right condition, it grows into an inflamed lesion. The oil produced from the skin helps bacteria to flourish within the swollen follicle. Non-inflammatory acre are of two types – Closed comedo or white head, and Open comedo or black head. There are 4 types of inflammatory acne – · Papule – It is the mildest form that appears on the skin as a small, firm pink bump. · Pustule – They are small round lesions containing visible pus. They may appear red at the base and yellowish or whitish at the center. · Nodule or Cyst – Large and painful, they are pus-filled lesions lodged deep within the skin. The nodules may persist for weeks or months with the contents hardening into a deep cyst. Both nodules and cysts often leave deep scars. · Acne Conglobata – This severe bacterial infection develops mostly on the back, buttocks and chest. The chief causes of acne are hormones like androgen, production of extra sebum, follicle fallout, bacteria and inflammation. For controlling acne, you can carry out the following steps – · Avoid excessive washing of your skin. It can leave the healthy skin dry, thus irritating the acne prone areas. Over-washing may also stimulate extra oil production. · Avoid alcohol products to tone your skin. Alcohol is a strong astringent that strips the top layer of the skin causing sebaceous glands to produce more oil. · Do not squeeze or pick the acne with fingernails, pins or any other thing. It forces the bacteria deeper into the skin and often leaves a permanent acne scar. · A wash is required after exercise. The heat and moisture trapped against the skin creates an ideal breeding ground for the spread of bacteria. · Consume food rich in Vitamin A, Vitamin B-2, Vitamin B-3, Vitamin E and Zinc like eggs, nuts, liver, milk, fish and leafy green vegetables. · Proper sleep and a life without stress and emotional anxiety can reduce acne. · Wear little make-up while exercising. Avoid garments that are made exclusively with nylon. Laser surgery is often used to reduce the scars left behind by acne. Treating acne with azelaic acid, salicylic acid, tropical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide is also common. A large number of people started trying herbal acne treatments over the traditional medications by using teas, oils and herbal creams.

Learn to dispel the myths and you are on your way to improving the condition. ","keywords":" acne, acne medication ","article_body":" What we think we know about acne is steadily being replaced by what scientists are learning. Meanwhile, many myths continue to circulate and endure. Clearing up some of the misunderstandings about acne is what this article is about. Myth #1 Acne only affects appearance Acne can also cause deep psychological distress. Severe acne can lead to low self-image and feeling depressed. There is a strong link between severe acne and social withdrawal. Myth #2 Acne is caused by poor hygiene While skin infections are associated with acne, lack of cleanliness is not the reason for acne outbreaks. The combination of oil and dead cells which produce acne is located beneath the skin's surface where it is impossible to clean it away. Gentle cleansing with soap and water once or twice daily will keep your skin as healthy as possible. Scrubing too hard may worsen acne. Myth #3 Acne is caused by specific foods Chocolate has long had a reputation as a pimple producer. Studies have shown no scientific evidence that this is true. The same holds true for potato chips and sugar. There are some foods that do seem to aggravate (not cause) the condition milk and foods high in iodine, such as seafood. Myth #4 Acne has to run its course There are many acne treatments available both over-the-counter and stronger medicines from a dermatologist. Myth #5 The more acne medicine the better Some people believe that if their acne gets worse they should just use more medicine. That's a bad idea because medicines can be dangerous when taken in large quantities. Excess use of acne ointments may just irritate the skin further. Myth #6 Sunbathing is good for acne Exposure to the sun dries out excess oils, so it does improve acne short-term. However, long-term the skin adapts and the acne is unfazed. Worse, there is scientific evidence that sun exposure damages the skin and increases the chance of skin cancer. Myth #7 Makeup causes acne Some makeup products can clog the pores, which is bad for the health of your skin. Cosmetics that are labeled \"noncomedogenic\" or \"nonacnegenic\" are safe to use. Some brands are made with ingredients that actually treat acne. Myth #8 Acne is only a teenage condition While most teens have acne, so do many adults. Acne generally clears up by the early 20s. But some people experience acne for the first time as late as their 40s. And for the most unfortunate of all, some people endure acne flare-ups their entire lives. Myth #9 Acne is related to sex We've probably all heard that either celibacy or too much sex causes pimples. There is no evidence for this. There is a link between sexual activity and hormone production, but the relationship between sex and the production of sebum (the oily substance which combines with dead skin cells to cause acne) is not known. Stress and anger also affect hormone levels. Myth #10 Popping pimples is the best way to get rid of them The fact is popping pimples may worsen acne by spreading the bacteria that is causing it. Popping can also lead to eventual scarring, which in severe cases, can be permanent.

Although acne is not contagious from person-to-person, it can spread to the whole face and can severely affect all the skin tissues that have pilosebaceous units. It is not true that acne just affects those going through puberty. Even infants or individuals who may be well over their forties, can develop this skin disorder. Acne infantilis is the term used for acne that grows on newborn babies, on the other hand acne rosacea is related to middle-aged people. Acne has different classifications, according to the severity of the infection. Comedo is the form where all severe acne cases originate. This is characterized by red swelling or small lesions on your skin. Whiteheads and blackheads are two forms of comedo. Conversely, blackhead is an open comedo. The coloration is due to the accumulation of dark skin pigments called melanin, plus hardened sebum and other skin debris and particles. This is the basic structure of whiteheads, however, the only difference is the coloration and these are deeply situated into the skin layers. If you have sandpaper-like skin around the tissue of your mouth and on the surface of your forehead, chin and cheeks, you probably have papules. Pus-filled lesions are also termed as pustules. Nodules on the other hand are similar with pustules. However, nodules are firmer and are larger acne growing deep in the skin. Inflammation may develop your pustules into containing semi-liquid or liquid materials composed of white blood cells (which are dead because of the acne-infecting bacteria named as Propionibacterium acnes), dead skin cells and active or inactive bacteria. This can result into more serious acne called cysts. In such situations, you may need the assistance of a skin dermatologist or physician. What is the cause of acne? It is quite difficult to exactly determine what may have caused your acne infection as reasons differ case to case. Studies indicate that the skin disorder may be brought about by many factors, including poor diet, stress, weather elements, and hormone changes or may be genetically influenced. Medically speaking, acne starts from the formation of hardened sebum, or the oily substance secreted to the skin through the sebaceous glands. This then will be permeated with acne-infecting bacteria, which in return will trigger the immune system to release white blood cells to obstruct the attack of the bacteria. As this happens, dead white blood cells and bacteria will accumulate in the hair follicles mixed with skin debris and dead skin particles, which then will inflame the lesions. Most mild case acne may be treated with over the counter acne medications. They are generally topical drugs, which you apply on your skin for acne treatment. They may come in the form of soaps, lotions, gels and creams. Conversely, systematic acne medications are taken orally. The most common of which are the antibiotics. Knowing that you are not the only one inflicted with acne at some point in life or another helps in that there will always be new research and new products coming on stream.

Adults in their twenties and beyond can still experience acne, and the negative effects of stress adds to the strain of having it pop up in their face. Studies show that mental stress can be a major cause in developing acne for adults. Moreover, women are likely to suffer from it because they are more exposed to stress which they acquire throughout their daily lifestyle. They are also prone to hormonal imbalances, especially at times when they have their monthly menstruation and during pregnancy. The environment is another factor in developing adult acne. If your surroundings are always dirty, most likely all the dust will be carried through the wind and eventually land on your face. If left unwashed, these dust and dirt can clog up your pores and infect them making the pore inflamed. Just like teen acne, the best treatment that you can avail of is maintaining proper skin care and a healthy personal hygiene. Take a bath everyday, and use mild soap only so that your acne wont further develop into an infection. Also watch out for your diet. Drink enough water and exclude from your meal some oily foods. Eat more fruits and vegetables. Take enough sleep and rest. It will relax your skin pores and eventually prevent acne from developing. The lifestyle of an adult is an important factor in the appearance of adult acne as well. Avoid drinking liquor, alcohol-based beverages and smoking. It will just make your face riddled with acne. You can also take some acne medications like skin care products and skin treatments. Just see your dermatologist so that he/she can determine which treatment would be right for you.

I don't want this to happen to you, so I have written a series of articles on how to clear your acne. Acne Is a Disease Acne is a disease called seborrhea or seborrheic dermatitis.  It occurs when the sebaceous glands, under your skin, become contaminated with oily toxic matter, which contains, §\tdirt §\tdead skin §\texcess sebum oil §\tacid waste §\tbacteria §\ttoxic matter Under normal conditions the sebaceous glands release oil that comes up through your pores onto the skin surface.  This release keeps your skin moist and lubricated for protection from the environment. If your pores on your face are not open or plugged, this creates toxic oil that cannot move out onto your skin.  This results in a growth or pimple that start to increase in size as more toxic oil tries to reach the surface of your skin. If the pore walls burst under the skin, white blood cells move in to digest the collagen around the pores.  When this happens, you will have scars on your face. To avoid having scars, you need to start an acne-clearing program before you get acne or just as soon as you see acne coming so that your pimples and back heads don't get to the point where they get severely infected and burst. Clearing Your Acne Acne is a complex condition that involves many parts of the body even though it shows up as only eruptions on the face and else where on your skin.  It is a signal that you have problems elsewhere deep within your body.  Acne can be caused by a toxic colon, poor digestion of food, weak liver and other conditions that cause the blood to carry too much toxicity. To clear acne it is not always possible to just do one thing and expect acne to go away.  But it may be possible to just use a special cream and have your acne diminish or clear. Acne may go away by just doing one thing but don't expect it to.  A facial cream, diet, herbal treatment, and colon cleanse alone may not be able to clear acne.  A combination may or may not work.

"},{"title":" Acne (and Rosacea) Link to MRSA ","word_count":808,"summary":" MRSA (multi resistant Staphylococcus aureus) is a huge problem in many hospitals leading to numerous deaths and increased hospital stays longer than normal. This has a huge impact on beds let alone peoples safety and confidence in their hospital. ","keywords":" acne treatment, rosacea treatment, MRSA, acne, rosacea ","article_body":" There is growing evidence that the major cause of MRSA is the inappropriate over prescribing of antibiotics by general practitioners. This is not news and it is common knowledge that most infections are viral and do not require antibiotics. Also it is well known that antibiotics upset gut bacteria and lead to overgrowth of the intestinal tract with fungi such as Candida which is present in everyone’s guts, but normally kept in check by the probiotic bacteria surrounding it and which also produce chemicals to keep it in check. Antibiotic use can reduce the probiotic bacteria and allow the fungus to grow which over time can lead to inflammation and misdiagnosis of IBS later in life and open another chapter in prescribing. A downward spiral we don’t want to promote. Candida overgrowth and dysbiotic guts probably affect millions of ‘20 something’s’ who have just had years of antibiotics for acne, or million of 40 something’s who have been put on antibiotics for rosacea. We have clever ways of restoring the normal bacterial balance and reducing Candida without harsh antifungals. However the use of antibiotics for skin infections such as acne and rosacea often at low doses and often for 3 to 6 months at a time is probably the biggest cause of MRSA (multi resistant Staphylococcus aureus) in hospitals. Let me explain. It doesn’t matter whether oral or cream antibiotics are used they cause the same problem. In acne if you have many blocked ‘pores’ (pilo sebaceous ducts) then the anaerobic bacteria propiobacterium acnes (p.acnes) can start to colonise the area under the plug and cause inflammation and damage. This bacterium only survives in normal skin at very low levels as it likes to live in an environment where there is little or no oxygen. When you create a blockage as with acne, you create the environment for p.acnes. So antibiotics can help to reduce p.acnes, but they also hit other friendly skin bacteria and herein lies the problem. Staphylococcus epidermidis (s.epidermidis) lives on our skin and helps keep other nasty bacteria away. It likes an oxygen rich environment. The same antibiotics that reduce p.acnes often hit the s.epidermidis as well. This attack puts selective pressure on the bacteria to survive and within three or four weeks you can isolate resistant strains s.epidermidis on skin being treated with antibiotics. Now Staphylococcus epidermidis is related to Staphylococcus aureus (s.aureus) (cousins if you like). S. aureus lives inside the body and s.epidermidis lives on the skin. They meet at places such as the nose and other entrances into the body. They can pass information to each other through the use of things called plasmids and it is highly likely information for developing resistance is transferred. Hey presto we have started the super bug development. The acne sufferer ends up in hospital for an operation. They get a wound infection either from their own bacteria but also through other bugs already there. S.aureus is a typical bacterium that infects wounds. The antibiotics used for wound infections are often the same or similar to the one that has been used for the patient’s acne, and it is not surprising they find the antibiotics don’t work as the bugs are already resistant. This resistant strain becomes the dominant resident s.aureus in the hospital and is extremely difficult to remove and can go on to infect many other patients. Using a product such as Aknicare which has 4 antibacterial agents which control p.acnes by changing conditions in the area under the plug rather than directly destroying it means you can prevent damage and inflammation without breeding resistant bugs. Aknicare can reduce p.acnes and all the other key causes of an acneic skin (inflammation, oil production, cell turnover) all without breeding resistant bugs. As a final thought the main treatment for rosacea recommended on PRODIGY, the GP prescribing database recommends ROSEX creams and gels. Rosex contains the antibiotic metronidazole. Rosacea patients often use it for months and years. It works in a few. Metronidazole is also a powerful antioxidant and it is these properties that help with rosacea symptoms, not the antibiotic properties. Rosacea is not caused by bacteria. It is a sobering thought that the antibiotic most used in theatre to prevent infections during and shortly after surgery is metronidazole. Imagine if you had been using it for months or years before that operation. It is concerning to think the antibiotic you are using today could end up leading to someone dying in hospital in the near future. Change prescribing habits for acne and rosacea now and have an impact on MRSA in hospitals. Use Aknicare, a new medical device with a CE mark . Once in the drug tariff this should be prescribed by GPs. PCTs should act now "},{"title":" Acne Asthma Drug Fails to Help Patients with Acne ","word_count":245,"summary":" The asthma drug Zyflo fails to help patients with severe acne, according to a mid-stage trial carried out by the company Critical Therapeutics Inc.

Back acne affects people ranging from age ten to age forty or older yet. Understanding the causes of back acne and available treatment options, are very important is treating and preventing the condition. Like all of the other forms of acne, there is no one thing that causes back acne. As far as the medical community stands, back acne also happens when oil glands start functioning more rapidly around puberty. The hormone group androgens, found in both females and males, get overactive which in turn causes a reaction in the oil glands, which make extra oil. The oil glands are located just underneath the skin surface. Oil glands constantly are producing and secreting oil through the pores in the skin. When too much of the oils are produced the pores and hair follicles become clogged. The clogs obstruct the way that dead cells escape the skin, which in turn results in a mess of oil and dead cells plugging the hair follicle. This attracts bacterium, which causes the acne to be formed. Back acne can be found on any part of the body and does not necessarily have to be on a person's back. It can be very severe with large lesions and painful cysts. Back acne may just be something that certain people are prone to or it could be caused by other things such as tight clothing or a heavy backpack. Not having anything in contact with the back is not a logical prevention step, as we all must sit down and everyone has to wear clothing. It is easier to treat back acne than to try and prevent it because most people suffer from back acne at one time or another.  Skin on the back is much thicker and therefore allows for stronger topical treatments, such as ten percent Benzoyl peroxide. This strength of Benzoyl peroxide is not suitable for other skin that is typically thinner and will not be able to sustain itself under harsh treatment. You can get all the same types of acne, blackheads, whiteheads, papules, pustules and cysts, on your back just as you can on any other part of your body. There are some differences in back acne and acne located elsewhere on the body however. Back acne is not caused by genetics as other acnes can be. Some severe cases of back acne may be genetically passed on but most likely it is just the individual's body type or personal genetic make up. People all over the world suffer from back acne at some point in their lives. Unlike other acne, food does not contribute to the formation or flare up of back acne. There is absolutely no evidence that foods cooked in grease, or high in fat content contribute to back acne. It is also known that excessive oil production and dirt build up does not have a huge impact on developing back acne. Perspiring excessively and not washing or showering immediately has been shown to not increase the chances of developing back acne. Back acne also does not seem to be affected by stress. There are some who think that facial acne is increased due to stress. However stress can cause back acne to not heal. Oftentimes, stress causes people to pick and bother the pimples, which make the condition worse. Taking some over the counter medicines may treat breakouts of back acne in conditions that are not complex. Some skin specialists or dermatologists should treat severe forms of acne on the back, such as cystic acne. Most of the simpler forms of acne might disappear with daily washing and cleansing routines but as cystic acne goes deep into the skin and can cause permanent scarring, it should be given more serious medical attention than simple pustules or blackheads on the back. Always speak to your healthcare provider about treatment before starting a back acne treatment program never attempt to treat severe acne on your own or with an over the counter product without consulting a professional.

There have been, however, few studies about people who have actually been exposed to antibiotics for long periods and there the importance of this one. According to experts, the ideal people to study consequences of using antibiotics for acne are patients with acne (an inflammatory disease involving the sebaceous glands of the skin; characterized by papules or pustules or comedones) , who use for long-term antibiotic therapy, representing a unique and natural population in which to study the effects of long-term antibiotic use. A group of experts from the School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, identified individuals diagnosed with acne between the years 1987 and 2002, aged 15 to 35 years, in a medical database in the United Kingdom (UK). The researchers searched information such as how often individuals were likely to see a physician, and compared the incidence of a common infectious illness, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), in individuals treated with antibiotics for acne and those whose acne was not treated with these medications. Experts reported that “within the first year of observation, 15.4 per cent of the patients with acne had at least one URTI, and within that year, the odds of a URTI developing among those receiving antibiotic treatment were 2.15 times greater than among those who were not receiving antibiotic treatment”.

Tons of acne medications get sold every year, this is a clear indication that people with acne are determined to get rid of them, at all cost. Some of these acne medications though simply cover up acne and do not really treat them. Getting rid of acne should be from its roots, their cause. Acne is the result of abundant amount of toxics in the body. These toxics can be an amassing of fat not properly disposed off, or accumulation of hormones the body produces. When the kidney, liver and the bowels could not dispose all of these toxins, they need to dispel them some other way. The body releases them either through the lungs or through the skin. This is when a breakout of acne can occur. The toxins released through your skin are the dirt and oil that causes the acne to swell up and get the pores infected. That is why most dermatologists recommend having the face and neck scrubbed regularly with soap and water to rid of these toxins. With a well-cleansed face, you eliminate the chances for the pores to be infected. Untreated acne can cause ugly scarring in the affected area that could be permanent. This blemish to the face could be quite hard to remove. Therefore, to prevent acne from happening you need to clean your face regularly as well as cut down on foods that are full of fats and hard to digest foods. Also cleanse your bowels and your waste system so that you won't have a build-up of toxins in your body.

Thus acne is a term for plugged pores [blackheads and whiteheads], pimples and even deeper lumps [cysts and nodules] that appear in different parts of the body. How does acne develop? Acne is a disease of the pilosebaceous units [PSUs], which consists of sebaceous glands connected to a canal, called a follicle that contains a layer of fine hair. These sebaceous glands produce an oily substance called sebum that normally empties onto the skin through the opening of the follicles. When the walls of this plugged follicle breaks down, it starts spilling everything like sebum, bacteria and shed skin cells, thereby leading to lesions and pimples. Factors that make acne worse Although the exact cause of acne is still unknown, but doctors have a strong belief that they result from various factors. One of the main factors include sudden burst of androgens that occur more during puberty. The factors of acne include heredity or genetics. Children usually have a tendency of getting acne from their parents and often get affected due to usage of drugs like androgens and lithium. However, there are several factors that can make acne worse §Changing hormone levels in adolescent girls and adult women §Excess secretion of oil after using of skin products like moisturizers and cosmetics. §Pressure from tight collars, tight sports uniform and backpacks §Environmental irritants like pollution and high humidity §Hard scrubbing of skin §Squeezing or picking at blemishes §Stress and anxiety Types of acne People suffering from acne can basically have a variety of lesions that can act as a detriment to the skin. Following are the types of acne §Comedo – an enlarged and plugged hair follicle that mainly produces whiteheads §Papules – inflamed lesions that usually appear as small pink bumps on the skin that can appear to be tender on touch §Cysts – deep, painful and usually pus-filled lesions that can cause scarring §Nodules – large painful solid lesions that are lodged deep within the skin §Pustules – papules topped with white and yellow pus-filled lesions that are basically red at the base How to treat acne? Dermatologists normally treat acne but often you can use some homemade recipes to prevent severe acne. You should wash your face at least thrice a day with cold water and a mild cleanser. Using essential oils like lavender, chamomile, calendula, juniper and mint with almond oil on your skin will give effective results. You should also start adding zinc supplements to your diet and avoid caffeine, junk food and salty foods. Other than these homemade recipes, you can also take prescribed medicines that contain benzoyl peroxide, salicyclic acid, sulfur, Azelaic acid, vitamin A, and OTC topical medicines to recover fast from acne.

Old wives’ tales about its causes continue to persist, in spite of scientific condition to the contrary. This article aims to shed light on some common myths about acne and attempts to separate fact from fiction. Myth 1 People who have acne are unclean and maintain poor hygiene There is absolutely no truth to this statement. Acne is caused by a hormonal imbalance in the body. When the oil glands responsible for keeping our skin waterproof and moist, over react to produce excessive quantities of sebum, they block the associated hair follicle, causing clogged pores, which develops into acne. So hygiene has absolutely nothing to do with it. In fact unnecessary scrubbing of the skin can exacerbate the problem. Do take care of your skin though - wash your face gently and pat dry. Myth 2 Eating the wrong foods will lead to acne The fact is that there is no co-relation between what you eat and acne. The chocolates, the French fries, the cheese pizza, and all those other fatty foods that have been lambasted ever so often, because of their unhealthy consequence have no affect whatsoever on your skin. However, eating a well balanced diet makes sense. So while you don’t have to be concerned as to whether your favorite treat affects your skin (at least directly), do remember that it does affect your overall health. Myth 3 Acne is caused by stress The truth is that the stress that most of us experience as part of our day-to-day existence does not lead to acne. Sometimes, acne can arise as the side-effect of drugs taken to treat severe stress. Talk to your doctor to find out if your stress medication is responsible for your acne. Stress can however make an already existing acne condition worse. Myth 4 Acne is a merely a cosmetic disease Well, acne does affect the way you look and yes, it is considered a threat to your physical well being. However, the fact remains that in some cases acne can lead to permanent scarring which is more than just purely cosmetic. Acne affects people psychologically. It is known to affect their perception of themselves, their self-esteem and confidence and their interaction with others. It can cause feelings of frustration, depression and social embarrassment. Myth 5 Acne can not be cured With the kind of products that are available in the market today, there is no reason why anyone should have to suffer the agony caused by acne. The fact is that acne can be cleared up with the right medication and a regime specific to their needs. Consult your dermatologist if you have acne.

According to scientific research, combining dapsone in a Solvent Microparticulate (SMP) gel enables dapsone to be applied topically and safely. This product achieved significant per cent reduction in the number of acne lesions and better success rate on the Global Acne Assessment Score in two randomized double-blind, vehicle controlled clinical studies in 3000 acne patients. Oiliness/peeling, dryness, and erythema were the most common adverse events reported from controlled clinical trials. However, there were no significant differences in the adverse event rates between Aczone Gel and vehicle control treated patients. 1.4 per cent of about 3500 patients had the enzyme deficiency -in the Aczone clinical trial program- which is consistent with the incidence in the general North American population. The company QLT will undertake a post-approval Phase IV study in 50 acne patients who have G6PD deficiency and follow them for 6 months, after which QLT expects to submit an application to the FDA to re-evaluate the Aczone label.

Acne infection is also an injury that needs repair and body sends white blood cells and other molecules that fight the infection and repair the infected site. After the repairing job is completed, a scar forms that is the sign of repair. Skin never becomes as smooth as it was before the acne. Some scar is always left. Let us find out more about acne scars and how doctors can repair them so that you get something similar to your earlier look again. Types Of acne scars- before we discuss about the type of scars, let us also note that everyone has different tendency of scar formation. Some people develop very less scars, while others may have major scars for the same type of acne. Acne scars are of two types- scars that are caused by loss of tissue and scars caused by increased tissue formation. Depressed Scars- these scars may be of different types such as Ice-pick scars, depressed fibrotic scars, soft scars and macular types. As the cyst expands with pus, bacteria, oil and dead skin cells it ruptures and attacks the dermis. to protect the dermis the white blood cells rush in. This rupture may cause loss of collagen giving rise to deep recess or depression. The skin above is left unsupported because of loss of tissue below it and a saucer shaped or jagged ice pick scar is formed. Ice pick scars are more common on face. Keloids- In some people the scar forms in a reverse fashion. With the loss of collagen, body triggers fibroblasts that produce excessive collagen producing scar tissues called keloids. Keloids are more commonly found on male torsos. Other type of increased tissue formation scar is called hypertrophic scar. Hypertrophy means overgrowth. Scar Treatment- scars can be treated by your dermatologist using different treatments. Before proceeding for scar treatment, you have to discuss your feelings about the scars with your doctor. The cost involved may also play a role in choosing the treatment. What results you desire is the third factor. The severity of the scar, the location and type of treatments that can be done are other factors that have to be used to treat acne scars. The common treatments for acne scars are- collagen treatment, laser treatment, dremabrasion, microdermabrasion, skin surgery, skin grafting etc. Keloids may be left untreated if it is felt that treatment will form further keloids. Injecting with steroid injections may also treat keloids. This article is only for informative purposes.

With rapid developments in dermatology, treating acne scars is becoming easier. Please consult your dermatologist about the best treatment for your acne scars. The choice will depend upon your medical history, the type of scar and the kinds of treatments available for that type of scarring. Some treatments are cheaper than others but may not give perfect results. The choice therefore also depends upon your budget and the kind of results you desire. Let us look at the kinds of treatments available for acne scars. Dermabrasion- this is considered one of the most effective treatments for acne scars. In this procedure the doctor uses a local anesthetic or freezes the skin and then uses a high-speed rotary abrader to remove unwanted surface skin. As the skin heals, it shows a brighter appearance. This procedure may remove superficial scars altogether and reduces deeper scars. Chemical Peeling - depending on the scar, your doctor will apply a mild chemical peel on the affected skin. This slowly peels away the old skin and brings in fresh skin. Mild scars can be treated with chemical peels. Laser Therapy- lasers of different types are used by the doctor to give a new shape to the scarred skin by recontouring the scars. The high burst of laser may leave the skin red for sometime. Soft Tissue Filling- Collagen that may be bovine in source or patients own may be injected below the scar to lift the skin and give a smooth appearance. As the injected collagen gets absorbed in the body over a period, further treatments may be needed after about six months. Similarly fat may be injected below deep scars for giving a lift to the skin. Similar to collagen filling, fat injections may need to be repeated after some months. Your doctor will advise you about that. Skin surgery- Skin may have to be surgically corrected with grafting or other procedures to remove some scars. Microdermabrasion- In this procedure very tiny aluminum oxide crystals are passed through a vacuum tube to scrape the surface of the skin. this procedure may have to be repeated many times, an d gives a fresh look to the skin by scraping .Very mild scarring can be treated with microdermabrasion. For people who have the tendency to form keloids, no surgical method can be used. If one can develop keloid with acne injury, more keloids will be formed by further surgery. steroid injections may be used to treat keloids. In some cases topical retinoic acid is applied directly on the keloids. This article is only for informative purposes.

Occurring at any age, but commonly in your teenage year's acne is one of the most frustrating skin conditions you can have. As a teenager I personally battled acne and lost.  I didn't know what caused it and there were myths all over about too much candy and chocolate, too much stress, preservatives in foods, sweating from exercise, etc.  There are probably hundreds of wrong statements about what causes acne and just as many home remedies that don't help to cure acne. Acne is caused by excessive oils on your skin that clog your pores and eventually will result in an infection, which produces the pimple with its redness and swelling.  A blackhead is simply a pore that has been partially plug by oils or dead skin but still remains open and doesn't have an infection. The key to controlling your acne is your ability to control the body oils that you have on your face, neck and shoulders. As a teenager your hormones are the cause of some of this excessive oil in you hair.  So it is important to keep your hair clean to help reduce the amount of oil you have around your face and shoulders. As a teenager, I had very oily hair and had acne on my shoulders, I had sought doctors help and tried many things but what finally got it under control was a shorter haircut and washing my hair at least once a day, in addition to keeping my face clean by washing with mild soap and water. If you have acne you should try not to pick at and pop your pimples. It can be very difficult not to pick at your acne, but what you are actually doing when you pop a pimple is spreading the infection to other pores in your skin.  You may have noticed that if you do pick at your acne it tends to spread, this is caused by spreading the infection (the white puss like substance) to other pores that may only be partially clogged but now have additional infectious material to completely clog the pore. Keep in mind acne can also be caused by some medications so if you're taking proper care to control your body oils and it still hasn't worked, you may be taking a medication that is the main cause.  Be sure to consult with your family physician as he can determine the side effects of your medication and adjust if necessary.

What are they and why are they called so? Let us find out. Acne develops on the hair follicles that have sebaceous glands attached to them. These glands produce an oil called sebum. Because of certain reasons the sebum changes in quality and quantity giving rise to scales on the hair follicle. This blocks the skin pore causing acne. This blockage is the beginning of acne. The first stage of this blockage shows as blackheads and whiteheads. These are also called as comedones. A comedone is a sebaceous follicle that is plugged and filled with sebum, dead cells etc. An open comedone is called a blackhead because of its blackish appearance. A blocked comedone is referred as white head, which is a small bump in the skin with skin like color. A whitehead has closed mouth and the blackhead has an open mouth. What to do if you have blackheads or whiteheads- do not squeeze them yourself. That may leave permanent scars and also infection. Best is to approach a dermatologist who will pick them open if required under sterile conditions. Please note that acne scars can permanently disfigure you. As far as basic care is concerned, wash your face gently with slightly warm water and mild soap to remove excess sebum and dead skin. Do not be harsh on the skin. Please note that acne takes time to clear. Apply any topical cream that may be prescribed by your dermatologist. Acne treatment requires patience.

A lot of patients do not respond adequately or develop side effects with the various oral and topical treatments available for the treatment of acne. Hence, the growing demand by patients who suffered from acne for a faster, safer, and side-effect-free novel therapy. The Dermatology and Lasers Clinic from Tel Aviv Msq, Caesarea, Israel, studied this concerning situation in order to address the role of light therapy in the armamentarium of treatments for acne vulgaris, to discuss photobiology aspects and biomedical optics, to review current technologies of laser/light-based devices, to review the clinical experience and results, and to outline clinical guidelines and treatment considerations, as they reported. After a series of clinical trials, results show that 85 per cent of the patients show an important quantitative reduction in at least 50 per cent of their lesions after four biweekly treatments. Approximately 20 per cent of cases demonstrate that acne eradication may reach 90 per cent. Three months after the last treatment, clearance is approximately 70 per cent to 80 per cent. Meanwhile, the non-respondent rate is 15 per cent to 20 per cent. According to researchers, laser and light-based therapies are a safe and effective modality for the treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris.

The Hammersmith Hospital in West London tested Low Level Laser Therapy normally used in private beauty salons on 30 patients who were suffering mild to moderate acne. In a period of 12 weeks their acne had halved. Meanwhile, those on a dummy treatment showed no improvement. Findings show that those with the most severe symptoms displayed the most astonishing improvement, mostly within the first month of treatment. Under experts conclusions, this is significantly faster than most conventional antibiotic treatments, which can take as long as eight months to work. The study showed that a single five-minute session could have a dramatic effect on acne for up to 12 months. Physicians used a treatment called pulse dye laser therapy in which the affected area is exposed to short bursts of light. The process had been used to combat wrinkles as it is known to stimulate the production of collagen. Tony Chu, the dermatologist who led the trial, explained that “we were brought in to see if the anecdotal evidence worked in a clinical trial and we found out it was very successful. However, we still do not know exactly how it works and that is an area we are now working on.” The expert said that the treatment appears to be showing the same kind of efficacy as antibiotics, but without the potential side effects. “What we need to do now is to see if it works as well on acne around other parts of the body, and work out the treatment which is most clinically effective”, stated.

There are many remedies for acne and currently a company created another one, the world's first chili pepper based face wash that has guaranteed to wipe out acne within a few short days, and without the burning sensation associated with hot peppers. A great part of remedies work, however, they take weeks and even months to make any noticeable difference. A lot of these products are also mixed with chemicals; they are expensive and generally require a daily regimen. Capsaicin, the active element in hot peppers has been shown to be an inportant acne fighter. According to experts, it works through a thermal heat action that helps to open pores and increase blood flow to the surface of the skin. Capsaicin has powerful antimicrobial properties that help distinguish harmful bacteria that's hiding within the layers of skin. Capsaicin also helps to desensitize sensitive skin by affecting a series of tiny nerves. Capsaicin may also be beneficial for relieving chronic topical pain associated with certain circulatory conditions. The golden product is called “Capsiderm”. Unlike arthritis creams -designed to relieve chronic muscle and joint pain- this new product is designed specifically to fight acne and tighten wrinkled lines on skin's surface. There are immediate results within the first day or two of use. According to the company, most acne conditions will disappear completely within the first week – even severe cases.

","keywords":" acne ","article_body":" Twenty-five percent of all adult men and fifty percent of all adult women suffer from some form of acne. These are the facts but how many adults have never had at least one acne flare up in their adult life? Adults can develop acne well into adulthood- twenties, thirties and forties and beyond that even. No acne is pleasant but somehow adult acne seems worse as acne is typically thought of as an adolescence problem. In reality adult acne, or any acne for that matter, is very hard to deal with and can lead to depression, a negative self-image and social anxiety may occur as well. The causes of adult acne are different for all people and the treatments vary as mush as the causes do. Most adult acne can be treated and managed effectively. The causes of adult acne are unknown; some people think that adult acne has hormonal roots. The appropriate adult pimple treatment may involve balancing your hormones, which typically requires a trip to your healthcare provider or dermatologist for some testing to conclude that hormones are indeed the problem. The development of a pimple is very detailed and very intricate. While it is known that pores that are clogged can block oil from escaping, it is not known why it happens in one pore and not another. It is also not known why this does not happen in all of the pores. The many causes of adult acne and teen acne include hormone imbalance, diet, genetics, vitamin deficiency, stress, and more. The real explanation may be a complex mix of many of these factors. Since it is not know what causes pimples, it is important to focus on the proper treatment of acne. Acne is often considered a hormonal disease or condition, meaning hormones are responsible for the maturing of the oil producing glands in our skin. Did you ever wonder why you never see acne on a young child? Young children do not have the hormones needed to mature the skin's oils. Once a person becomes and adult there are many things that can throw our hormones out of balance and in turn wreak havoc on our skin, among other things. Some things that cause such imbalances are puberty, pregnancy, menopause and many other things that cause hormones to flare up. Acne may be precipitated by androgens, the male hormones found in men and women. Oil surpluses made by these hormones are the biggest cause of clogged pores and hair follicles, which results in bacteria growth and acne pimples and blemishes. Acne that is caused by hormones is typically more prevalent in women during natural cycles like menstruation, pregnancy and menopause. Treatment for adult acne is very effective and there are many forms of treatment available. The best treatment happens to be the same treatment recommended most for teenage acne. Benzoyl peroxide kills acne much better than any other acne medication out there on the market today, including all prescription medications. For this product to be effective an acne sufferer must use enough of the product and use it according to the given instructions. If used correctly and in a large enough amount the acne will start to clear up. This method of treatment is also very simple and is not evasive in any way. Benzoyl peroxide does not have a negative effect on the skin first unlike other prescription acne treatments, meaning you will not see a worsening of the skin before you see the improvement. Skin does not build up a tolerance to this treatment so it will be effective for long-term use. If it works on acne the first time, it will always work. There may be a genetic component involved meaning acne can run in families. Up to fifty percent of women whose acne continues beyond their teens show evidence of increased androgen levels, with raised testosterone and/or lowered sex hormone binding globulin, a protein found in the blood. Correction of these abnormal hormonal imbalances often improves symptoms, so you need to see to it that your doctor is prepared to measure these hormone levels and help you seek a treatment. Several different treatments are available over the counter to help mild to moderate symptoms and your pharmacist can advise on which product would suit you best. It is important to realize that adult acne is more common than most think and adult sufferers are not alone, there is a large population of adult acne sufferers. If you are troubled by adult onset acne, first consult your doctor.  He or she may have a hormonal adult acne treatment that can help. If you have adult acne and it is severe or causes you pain do not hesitate to talk to your healthcare provider and discuss possible medical treatment of your acne.

This time length is different for every individual, but is usually early twenties. There is now way for medical professionals to predict the acne timeline for an individual. Some individuals will even be affected by acne several users later, in their thirties and forties. Although acne is not a very pleasant condition to have, due to the large array of people that it affects at some point in their life, it has become somewhat socially acceptable if kept under control. \"Common Acne\" is the most wide spread form of acne, which is as a result of naturally occurring dead skin cells blocking the hair follicles while an excessive of oil is secreted from the skin glands. Oil that is blocked under the skin builds up, and provides the perfect environment for bacteria to uncontrolably multiply. The Part of the Infection that we are used to seeing is the visible lesion that becomes visable as the skin inflames. Most individuals are only affected with acne on their face, but it should be noted that acne can affect the chest, back, shoulders, among other areas of the body as well. Generally, acne doesn't cause any long term medical implications. If Acne lesions are out of control, they can however, leave scars as the skin has been permanently damaged. Acne is more generally associated with social implications such as low self-esteem. Adolescence is a hard stage of life for most individuals, and the persistance of acne with our social agendas doesn't make it any easier.

Quick Acne Tips 2 If a non-electric razor is your choice, a single-edged blade is actually better. Why? Because double- and triple-edged blades grab hair follicles and pull them out from below the epidermis. And in the process, your skin \"heals itself\" by closing over these holes, making it difficult for future hair follicles to grow outward - creating inflammation in the tight areas. Quick Acne Tips 3 Thoroughly clean your face and any other areas where cosmetics are applied daily, especially if used when combined with exercising or other activities that promote sweating, where there is the opportunity for the chemicals to be absorbed or soaked up into your pores. Quick Acne Tips 4 Cosmetics - To avoid pore-clogging and skin irritations that are similar to acne and that can contribute to acne, use products labeled \"noncomedogenic\" or \"oil-free.\" Shimmering facial colors can contain a flaky mineral called mica that can cause skin irritations and clog pores. Other additives in coloring that can cause similar reactions are coal tar derivatives, carmine and heavy cream in blushes. Quick Acne Tips 5 More preventative measures include using a lip gloss that promotes a matte finish instead of a high gloss for less pore-clogging; note the more the shine, the more then comedogenic content and the more the pores can clog. Beware that eye creams can contain heavier concentrations of moisturizers than regular creams and lotions, meaning they have greater potential to clog pores in the surrounding facial areas. Quick Acne Tips 6 Additionally use caution with hair styling products that contain oils, alcohol and adhesives that should be kept away from skin and from seeping into pores along with perspiration during workouts; especially watch hair gels and mousses so that they don't cause clogging around your hairline. Use care when choosing fragrance and scented cosmetics, too, and opt for \"hypo-allergenic\" or \"fragrance-free\" versions where possible to avoid allergic reactions and skin irritations (a sampling 3-day test behind an ear is recommended).

There are other skin problems that look like acne but are not acne. Milia is one of them. Milia are white spots on the face that can form at any age. Milia look like white pearls and most of us confuse them with whiteheads of acne. They are not whiteheads. So the treatment is different. Common acne treatment will not help remove milia but create more skin problems. Find out the difference between milia and whiteheads for a good-looking face. Acne- what are whiteheads whiteheads form when the dead skin cells, white blood cells, bacteria P.Acnes and sebum block the opening of the sebaceous glands. The gland has a closed mouth and this comedone is called acne. This acne troubles us because if it gets further infected, it can create scarring and spoil the facial skin forever. Mila- milia is the accumulation of dead skin cells that is not able to get out of the skin. Milia has no infection like whiteheads and no bacteria or pus. Milia has no sebum in its formation. Our skin sheds dead skin cells everyday. Sometimes, when these cells cannot be shed out from the skin, they accumulate and form miila. When you extract a milia from the skin, you will only see white mass. They are dead skin cells. Milia treatment- the only way to remove milia is to get them extracted from skin. Don't extract milia yourself if they are located on your eyelids. The best way to prevent milia is to get the top skin layer exfoliated regularly. Get microdermabrasion done regularly. AHAs are also good for removing the top dead skin cells regularly. Vitamin A derivative creams are also good to peel off the top skin layer. Consult your doctor about prevention and removal.

Acne is very common, with an estimated 80% of all people worldwide expected to suffer from some sort of acne in their lifetime.  For those who suffer from the occasional zit, acne is a transient annoyance that is not of much concern most of the time.  For others, acne is a daily obsession that can make a serious impact on a person's self-esteem and overall psychological health. Most people who suffer from acne resort to harsh chemicals and conventional antibiotic therapies to heal their blemishes.  Fortunately, more options are available now than ever before.  If you are considering seeking out alternative therapies, here is a quick run-down of the latest methods for treating acne. Blue light therapy  Blue light therapy is aimed at acne patients who have had little success with other treatments.  Blue light therapy focuses on eradicating the bacteria that causes most forms of acne, propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes).  P. Acnes creates the small molecules known as porphyrins that in turn help produce the bacterium that causes most types of acne inflammation. Blue light therapy works by zeroing in on the porphyrins.  Porphyrins that are exposed to the blue light are able to produce free radicals that destroy the P. acnes bacteria. Blue light therapy is rapidly becoming a popular treatment for acne because it is non-invasive and drug-free way to help heal blemishes.  Many topical medications contain strong ingredients that damage sensitive skin, resulting in peeling, redness, and increased sun sensitivity.  Blue light therapy is widely regarded as an easy and drug-free alternative to most acne medications.  Some individuals have expressed concern over the safety of blue light therapy.  In the past, light therapy options have not been considered 100% safe.  Past light therapy treatments consisted of ultraviolet light that was harmful to the skin.  Fortunately, modern blue light therapy has been FDA approved and is free of UV light. So how does blue light therapy work?  Generally, blue light therapy is administered in gradual increments.  A common schedule of treatment might consist of eight sessions given over a period of four weeks.  Blue light therapy sessions are short, usually lasting about 15 minutes.  Visit a skin specialist or dermatologist to receive more information, or to receive a treatment of blue light therapy. Another form of light therapy that is used to treat acne is known as pulsed light and heat energy (LHE) therapy.  LHE therapy uses both light and heat to eradicate the root causes of acne.  Like blue light therapy, LHE therapy uses light to destroy acne-causing bacteria.  LHE therapy also uses heat to reduce the production of sebum and to help shrink sebaceous glands.  LHE therapy is an attractive option for many acne sufferers because it promises fast results.  Usually, improvement in the symptoms of acne can be seen in as early as 30 days.  LHE therapy is also becoming popular because it is a fast treatment, with most sessions done in just over 10 minutes.  The FDA has approved LHE therapy for the treatment of mild to moderate acne. While different kinds of light therapies may seem attractive, they can also be expensive, and may not be covered by most health insurances.  If you are looking for a therapy that is milder and less expensive, consider many the many herbal therapies that available.  Many herbs have been signaled as potentially therapeutic.  Some acne sufferers swear by certain herbal supplements, including black currant seed oil and evening primrose oil.  Both herbs are recommended to acne sufferers.  Try taking three 500-milligram capsules each day to control your acne.  It may be helpful to create an herbal diary of sorts, where you can track the herbs you are taking and their efficacy. Beside herbs, certain vitamins and minerals are also highly recommended for acne sufferers. Vitamin A is perhaps the most important vitamin for the production and maintenance of a healthy complexion.  Vitamin A helps control the amount of sebum produced by your skin, and it is also a key vitamin in the production of keratin.  Vitamin A is very potent, and must only be taking in controlled doses.  Consult your doctor about the appropriate amount of Vitamin A for your situation.  Other important 'skin' vitamins are Vitamin B-6 and Vitamin E.  An important mineral for the maintenance of a healthy complexion is Zinc.  Approximately 30-50 mg of Zinc daily is recommended for acne sufferers.

Now because the problem is so important in so many ways it is easy to see why there has been so much effort put into learning about the problem and trying to solve it. There are a ton of different ways offered to cure acne and some are a lot more worthwhile than others. These cures range from spreading disgusting mixtures of organically produced potions to ultrasonic technology that \"zaps\" the gland that is producing the offending inflammation. That is what acne is by the way, inflammation that starts deep down in the dermal layer, that attracts all sorts of different immune competent cells to make the pain, redness, swelling, and pus that you find with acnes. It would be great if we new what turned the \"switch\" on to this inflammation-- but the fact is that we do not. We know that several factors bring it on, a major one being puberty and all of the changes especially the hormonal ones that start circulating through the body. Another major focus is the dirt and oil that get on your face during the day and that you grind in on your pillow at night that is clogging the pores and producing the crops of zits. Another think is the foods that we eat namely foods high in oils, sugars, and chocolate. The trouble with all of these ideas is that as much as you work to change these factors the chances are that you will not get rid of the painful and unsightly red pus filled pimples. You can wash until the take off the first layer of skin but you won't get rid of them all. You can also stop eating anything good, trying to avoid the foods that supposedly cause acne but if you have any success it will only be partial. So obviously we haven't found what is at the root of the problem but that doesn't mean the effort isn't there. So my recommendation at this point is to get a doctor that will take the time to get to understand who you are and what methods would be most effective for your particular strain of acne. They have access to the best training and information and they are in the best spot to start working with your individual case and hopefully make your life a lot better.

Acne affects personality and emotions of people. Although it is a common problem, it devastates even who are stronger. According to the Academy of Dermatology, almost every teen aged 12 to 17 will suffer from some form of acne, but 40 per cent of those will develop severe acne. They will not get pimples; they will get cysts that can cause scarring and emotional devastation. “I didn't make very many friends, not wanting to date anyone. I didn't want anyone to touch my face, not looking in mirrors. It was really sad”, tells Chelsea. She even covered all the mirrors in her house, so she could not see herself. Chelsea tried everything in treatment and medication, such as pills, creams, different face washes, medicated makeup, but nothing seemed to work.

Some of these acne treatments that help to reduce or eliminate acne problems are Accutane, antibiotics, Benzoyl Peroxide, herbal remedies, Retin-A and Salicylic Acid, among others. Accutane (Isotetinoin) is a powerful drug that is normally prescribed for severe acne in cases where other treatments have failed to work. It is normally taken for a 4-6-month period. Antibiotics were designed to fight bacteria. These are used to control acne mainly from the inside. Some topical antibiotics (clindamycin) are applied directly to the skin. Other antibiotics (tetracycline) are in pill form. Benzoyl Peroxide is an anti-bacterial agent that has been used to control acne for many years.  It has been proven to work very well in the elimination and prevention of acne. Herbal Remedies are a relative newcomer to mainstream acne fighting.

So what causes acne? ","keywords":" acne, acne treatment, acne medicine, acne product, adult acne, acne remedy, acne skin care, blackheads, whiteheads ","article_body":" Though acne may not be a serious problem, it can sometimes lead to psychological and mental stress. Many people lose their self esteem because of this problem. So what causes acne? Acne is caused by hormonal disorder. Excessive secretion of the skin oil glands combine with naturally occurring dead skin cells and block the hair follicles. This oil secretion beneath the blocked pore provides a perfect environment for the skin bacteria Propionibacterium acnes to multiply, and thus the skin inflames producing the visible lesion. Acne commonly occurs in adolescents and young adults. Almost 85 percent of people between the ages of 11 and 30 have acne outbreaks at some point. Acne tends to go away by the time you reach your thirties, but for some people it may even go up to their forties and fifties. Causes of Acne Several other factors that cause Acne are • Hormonal changes during menstrual cycles and puberty. • Stress, as it causes an increase in output of hormones from the adrenal glands. • Hyperactive sebaceous glands, secondary to the three hormone sources above. • Build-up of dead skin cells. • Bacteria in the pores. • Skin irritation or scratching of any sort will activate inflammation. • Use of anabolic steroids. • Medicines that contain halogens (iodides, chlorides, bromides), lithium, barbiturates, or androgens. • Sudden exposure to high levels of chlorine compounds, particularly chlorinated dioxins. Adult acne 25% of adult men and 50% of adult women get affected by adult acne at some time in their adult lives. It can cause depression and social anxiety the same way it can in a teenager. Adult acne is more common than people may think. The causes of adult acne are unknown; however it is believed to occur because of these reasons • Recurrence of acne that cleared up after adolescence • Flare-up of acne after a period of relative quiet, especially during pregnancy It is best to consult a dermatologist for the proper treatment. You would have to use Clear Skin Regimen using benzoyl peroxide. Treatment for adult acne is the same as treatment for teen acne. Body acne Body acne is a common problem which occurs mostly on the chest, back and buttocks. Like facial acne, stress and hormones are the cause. Other factors like perspiration and wearing tight fitting clothing also causes body acne. Tight-fitting clothing traps perspiration against the skin and mixes with surface oils, thus clogging the pores and causing blemishes. Treatments The treatment is aimed at healing the existing lesions, stopping new lesions from forming, and preventing scarring. The dermatologist would prescribe several over-the-counter (OTC) medicines depending on the extent of the problem. Some of the medicines would be topical to apply on the skin and others may be oral. Some of the common OTC topical medicines are • Benzoyl peroxide – This helps to destroy acne and also reduces oil production. • Resorcinol – This helps in breaking down blackheads and whiteheads. • Salicylic acid – This helps in breaking down blackheads and whiteheads. It also cuts down the shedding of cells lining the hair follicles. • Sulfur - This helps in breaking down blackheads and whiteheads. The prescription topical medicines include • Antibiotics - They help slow or stop the growth of bacteria and reduce inflammation. • Vitamin A derivatives – They help in unplugging the existing comedones, thus allowing other topical medicines to enter the follicles. • Others - Benzoyl peroxide, sodium sulfacetamide/sulfur or Azelaic acid help to reduce oil production or help stop or slow the growth of bacteria and reduce inflammation. Following these treatments would cure your acne, and the psychological stress and embarrassment caused by this disease will also go away.

It is, however, more prevalent in teenagers when hormones are at their most active. Heredity also plays a large part in who gets acne and how severe it may be. Those who are genetically inclined to acne will often get more severe cases than people who are simply going through a stress induced or hormone induced acne phase. They also may have a more difficult time clearing up blemishes. The blemish that occurs on the skin can be unsightly and embarrassing so prevention and treatment should be the focus. The best form of treatment for acne is prevention as it is with any affliction. You should try to keep your hands away from your face because dirt and oils can contaminate pores. Proper health is also important. This means proper diet, exercise and sleep to reduce stress. Keeping your face clean using mild soap is also a good preventative. If you have an outbreak, there are home remedies, over the counter medications and prescription medications that can help. There are several topical creams and soaps that are used in the treatment of acne. These can be found in pharmacies and in the cosmetics department of grocery stores. Benzoyl peroxide creams, vitamin A and zinc are all used to help treat acne. For more severe cases a prescription oral antibiotic may be prescribed along with a topical cream that is stronger than the over the counter medications.

These products have great qualities that are inherent in the most ordinary things that can make you beautiful, cleansing your skin and brightening your complexion. The mask made of eggs is one of the most common and it is a good method for toning the skin, according to some experts. They say that eggs help tightening your skin, giving you a firmer face, less wrinkled and less prone to sagging. To make an egg mask is something quite simple and fast that you can not even imagine. First, beat one egg white until it is stiff. After that you just smooth it over your entire face. Then, remove the mask, but after 20 minutes. You can adjust the mask to your skin type. If your have oily skin, add lemon juice to the egg white (only one drop). And if you have dry skin, put a bit of honey to the egg white. Experts explain that the skin on the inside of the shell can actually work as an acne treatment. Just place the skin over the breakout and leave on for 30 minute or even overnight to help reduce the appearance of the acne. It is recommended to apply facial masks once a week for best results. Remember rinsing your face first with warm water and then rinsing with cold (to close the pores) after you finish removing the mask. "},{"title":" Acne - Your Hormones May Be The Culprit! ","word_count":675,"summary":" Knowing that your hormones may be contributing to your acne problems can determine which course of treatment to take. This article gives a quick rundown of some particular causes of acne. ","keywords":" Acne, Acne Treatment, Hormones, Problem, Control, Medication, Prevent ","article_body":" Copyright 2006 Tony Buel Acne can often be considered the worst thing to happen to a teenager. Where in the world does it come from and how do you get rid it once you have it? They are a source of endless embarrassment and inconvenience!  And while everyone has suffered from them to some extent, no one likes them. Major culprits in causing acne can be simple hormones. Specifically, the male hormone 'testosterone' can cause acne. During puberty the teenagers' body is changing. During this time, most teenagers produce abnormal levels of the male hormone testosterone. Most people outgrow this condition by their early twenties, but with some people it lasts longer. Women also produce additional hormones during the menstrual cycle, and for many women this can lead to more problems with acne. If this occurs, visiting with a doctor or other medical professional can provide a cure or remedy. There is also a medical theory that stress contributes to acne because it causes an increased output of hormones from the adrenal glands. Additionally, hyperactive sebaceous glands are secondary to other hormone sources, menstrual cycle, stress and testosterone. Some people's bodies also over produce something called sebum, which is a contributing factor to acne. While this is not the only cause, it certainly contributes. Add to this the accumulation of bacteria in the pores of the skin, dead skin cells accumulation, and irritation caused by scratching or rubbing. Acne can also be caused, or made much worse by the use of anabolic steroids, used by some athletes. Also some medications contain halogens, including iodides, chlorides, and bromides. These medications can contribute to acne, as can lithium, barbiturates and androgens. Chlorine exposure can also cause a type of acne known as chloracne, which is especially severe and can be long lasting. With the knowledge that hormones play a major role in causing acne, many of the misconceptions about acne can be addresses and discounted. One of these is diet. For many years people thought that fried foods and chocolate caused acne. There are a couple of reasons for this. People associated fried foods with oily skin, and assumed that consuming oil or grease had to make the skin greasy and more prone to acne. This is not the case. Also, teenagers are food-consuming machines. In fact, many dieticians have said that the fact that teenagers consumer so much food is the main reason their diets usually include nutritious foods - the fact that they eat everything. However, pizza, hamburgers, French fries, chocolate shakes, candy bars, and other foods that are often favorites of teenagers, have been erroneously blamed for acne for years. While eating good, nutritious foods and making sure that you include vegetables, fruits, lean meats and whole grains in your diet will certainly improve your health, and therefore might improve acne, there is no direct link of diet and acne. French fries are not to blame, and neither are pizza or candy bars. There is just no real connection. Also, bad personal hygiene has been blamed for acne and caused many teenagers embarrassment. No matter how clean they kept their faces they still had zits. In addition, excessive cleaning can actually make acne worse. If the skin is damaged by rough washing, or becomes dried out, then chances are acne will be worse. Also many over the counter products sold to make acne better can actually clog pores and make acne worse as well. There are many good treatments available for acne. Of course, seeing your doctor is best. Many good prescription drugs are available. Many of these drugs can control the output of testosterone, and some can help women with menstrual cycle difficulties. If that is not an option, visit a pharmacy and consult with the pharmacist on over the counter remedies that are beneficial. Also moderate washing, good nutrition, protection of the skin when out in the sun, and time seem to be the best cures. Be encouraged that with the passage of time, everyone recovers from acne, the bane of the teenager's existence!

And once you have it, prepare to be tormented, embarrassed and humiliated. Such a small bump, so much at stake. So what is this little bundle of horror? What else but the dreaded pimple! A pimple, or acne as some people calls it, is a dreaded red, swollen bump in the face. Nobody is spared from having it. Male or female, American, Chinese or Puerto Rican, they all have gotten it at some points of their lives and may even still have it. It is like a universal language; it is like a right of passage in a person’s life. Acne is a result of the hormones action on the skin's oil glands (the sebaceous gland) which leads to clogged pores and outbreak of lesions like pimples, blemishes or acne. Acne commonly occurs in the neck, face, back, shoulders and chest because the sebaceous glands are most abundant in these locations. But the important question we should be asking to be able to avoid this dreaded “disease” is, “What causes this pain in the neck called acne?” Unfortunately, the causes of acne cannot really be determined (unless your parents or their parents are acne infested too then there’s a big, big chance you’ll be called acne face by your peers and classmates) thus the acne myths are born! These myths claim to be the cause of acne. We shall enumerate them here. Acne Myth Number 1 Acne is caused by not washing your face often and not scrubbing it hard enough. Many believed that acne is caused by dirt and dust in the face and by washing your face two-three even four times a day or even by scrubbing your face hard can prevent acne. Wrong, wrong, wrong! It is true that dirt and dust is unsightly to the face and washing the face is the way to eradicate them but washing often can actually irritate the skin more. Washing should not be done more than twice a day. More than twice is enough to strip the face of its natural oils making it dry. Also, scrubbing can cause inflammations. Washing the face should be done as gently as possible with the gentlest facial scrub. Acne Myth Number 2 Improper Diet can cause acne. Certain foods that are oily like French fries and junk food can cause acne to erupt in our face. But scientific studies have not discovered any connection between these two. So this means that food does not cause acne. Though a proper and healthy diet is always good for our system, eating like a pig won’t make pimples a permanent resident in your face. So feel free to eat your favorite Lay’s, French fries and chocolates anytime. Acne Myth Number 3 When you’re stressed acne tends to pop on your face like popcorn pops from a kernel. Not true. Stress is a part of our daily lives and believe it or not it is not a contributing factor to the acne residing in your face. Only severe stress treated by the doctor MAY cause acne to erupt only as a side effect of the drugs a person may be taking. If this is the case, consult your doctor immediately.

These acne lesions might appear as blackheads, whiteheads, nodules or cysts. Most people get acne in their teen years. Some get it in their forties. Acne isn't going to threaten your life, of course, but it could seriously interfere with it, especially if it disfigures you for the rest of your life. Acne doesn't have to be severe to cause disfigurement. The onset of puberty brings hormonal changes to our bodies and these changes can cause acne. Oil glands, called sebaceous glands because they secrete sebum (oil) are now working more than they were during your childhood before puberty. Androgens, male hormones, are the primary culprit for this abundant secretion. Girls and women have androgens, though they don't have as many as boys and men. A hair follicle starts the acne ball rolling. This sebaceous follicle, inside the sebaceous gland, is where acne happens. Puberty gets skin lining cells shedding more than in childhood but when they stick together as they sometimes do the extra oil results in a clogged pore. The oil builds up in this pore but can't get out. The follicle swells up and you have a lesion. P.acne, a bacterium present in your skin starts to multiply to excess because of the clogging in the follicle. Your skin is now irritated and probably inflamed. Should the follicle burst at this point the skin around the follicle is going to react too. You are now going to have nodules, blackheads and/or pimples elsewhere on your skin. You now have acne lesions. There are myths about acne that have been around for a long time that give you false information about acne. Let's dispel those myths right now. One of the more common of the false ideas you could have about acne is that if your hygiene is poor you're going to get acne. While you may very well get acne that poor hygiene is not the cause. Believing that could make your acne ever so much worse as you harshly scrub your poor face into irritation. Of course you don't want excess oil and dirt from the day's ventures sitting on your face, but when you wash it away be gentle. Only wash your face twice each day, and do so gently. Drying should be patting gently instead of vigorously. If you still have acne try something at the pharmacy that says it treats acne or see a dermatologist. Stress doesn't affect or cause acne. This is a myth and it's not true. The stress you encounter throughout the day isn't going to bring on acne. Even were you to have stress beyond normal levels and take medication prescribed by your doctor that level of stress still isn't going to cause acne. The medication might, however, and if it does, tell your physician. Let's also dispel the myth that the food that you consume affects your acne. Nothing could be further from the truth. Yes, do get a healthy balanced diet but don't think it's going to clear up your acne or prevent it from occurring. It won't. Don't listen to those people who pooh pooh your acne complaints with comments about it only being cosmetic. As a teen especially, there is no \"only\" to cosmetic flaws. It's a self-esteem issue, and it could be that permanently if that acne gets bad enough and exists long enough to scar you forever.

","keywords":" acne, acne treatment, acne medication, cures, remedies, scars, laser, vulgaris, rosacea ","article_body":" Acne is a disorder of the skin that affects adults as well as teens. It occurs when follicles, or pores, become blocked. Oils, naturally present in skin, are unable to drain and become blocked inside the follicles. Before long bacteria begins to grow. Skin blemishes referred to as blackheads and whiteheads then begin to appear. When the oil and bacteria that is trapped remain below the skin, the blemish is referred to as a whitehead. A blackhead occurs when the oil and bacteria are partially exposed. The color of the blemish turns black due to pigmentation within the skin. Blackheads usually last far longer than whiteheads due to the fact that it takes longer to drain. It is believed that hormones, diet, stress and vitamin deficiency may play a role in the development of acne. While acne includes both whiteheads and blackheads, there are a variety of types of acne that range in severity. Acne Vulgaris is the most common form of acne and includes everything from whiteheads and blackheads to cysts. Acne Vulgaris may be either mild or moderate as well as severe. The mild and moderate forms of Acne Vulgaris include common pimples with inflammation apparent below the surface of the skin as well as blackheads. Small red bumps that have no ‘head’ may also be present and are known as papules. Acne Vulgaris in its most severe form includes lesions that are known as nodules and cysts. These are normally much larger than mild or moderate acne and may be more painful. Nodules are usually small and hard, below the skin and do not contain pus while cysts do. Scars can appear if Acne Vulgaris is not treated correctly. A gentle cleanser and a benzoyl peroxide cream can be effective in treating mild to moderate forms of Acne Vulgaris. Avoid overwashing; gently cleansing the face in the morning and at night should be sufficient. Taking care not to touch your face during the day and using oil free cosmetics may also help. Extreme caution should be used in trying to ‘pop’ pimples, as this can result in scarring. Papules (small red bumps with no head) should never be popped or squeezed. Acne Rosacea can easily be confused with Acne Vulgaris and often appears to be quite similar. Most people who suffer from Acne Rosacea are adults over the age of 30. A red rash along with bumps and pimples signal the presence of Acne Rosacea, which normally appears on cheeks, nose, forehead and chin. Blackheads are normally not present with Acne Rosacea. This type of acne can be quite serious because when it is left untreated it can actually cause excessive tissue to begin growing. There are three types of extremely severe acne; all of which can be disfiguring. Acne Conglobata usually appears in men instead of women. It is commonly found on the trunk and limbs of the body instead of the face. Individuals normally develop this form of acne at some point between the ages of 18 and 30. It can remain active for several years and can be extremely difficult to treat. Dermatologists normally use Accutane as a treatment. Young men sometimes experience what is known as Acne Fulminans. Typical acne may be accompanied by fever and aching joints with the onset of Acne Fulminans. Oral steroids as well as Accutane may be used to treat this form of acne. Women between the ages of 20 and 40 may experience what is known as Pyoderma Faciale. This type of acne is generally confined to the face. Unlike other forms of acne, this form does not last for years; instead its presence is normally restricted to a year or less. It can, however; be very painful as well as disfiguring.

He used to get patchy-redness and sudden flushing all the time, sometimes he had a pimple or two but his skin used to remain oily all the time. He used to wash his face every couple of hours with medicated soap but his face used to get oily very quickly. The problem was that he didn’t even realize that he had rosacea for the first few years until his skin specialist diagnosed him with rosacea. He became self-conscious and used to avoid gatherings. He tried many different treatments and medicines antibiotics, Retin-A you name it he tried it including herbal treatments. Even used gram flour and orange peel, which his grandma prepared and forced him to used but nothing worked for him. First I had Acne and now adult acne, what is the problem with me? The question he used to ask himself and to everyone else almost everyday for which the answer we still don't know. He tried different creams and changed his skin specialist again and again to find the right one. But unfortunately nothing and no one could help him. This is because what causes rosacea is still unknown. It is still a mystery even for some doctors that which rosacea treatment is actually right for someone who has rosacea. It’s not that treatments do not work with rosacea, some treatments work well, but which one is the right one is a million dollar question. Until one day when his mum's ever increasing criticism became unbearable he stopped using soap, drinking more water and he started washing his face only with warm water. In his own words the first 3 weeks were terrible for him. He could not go out, he could not face anyone. I think it was just his imagination that he looked awful but after that his face accepted water and the oiliness of his face started to decline. It took about 2 months before his face started to remain dry and he got rid of oiliness. The flushing was still the big problem for him. Even though he promised himself that he will not used any new treatment but a sudden flare-up still made him look around for treatments. Then he discovered Jojoba Oil, which was a turning point and a true-life saver for him, that’s what he says about the oil. It took about a week before his face actually accepted the oil. The best thing was the application of Jojoba oil was simple, just warm water a drop of pure jojoba oil every morning and evening and his face redness started to decline. Nowadays he doesn't get sudden flare-ups. I hope that some people who are suffering from acne rosacea, if increase the use of water and use jojoba oil instead of experimenting on new medicated soaps and creams then they might help them with their rosacea problem.

Due to the oily nature of sebum and its exposure to dust and dirt causes bacterial growth and results in what is commonly known as the pimple. Pimples are not the only outcome of such bacterial formations. Cysts, whiteheads, blackheads are also quite common depending on exposure and skin types.

Herbal treatments for acne are much sought after now a days, since traditional acne treatments have become very expensive and so have dermatologists. Herbal or alternative acne treatments have become more and more popular due to lack of considerable side effects that most acne treatments seem to have. Not only the lack of side effects, but also additional benefits like vitamin and botanical nourishments such as DMAE (anti-oxidant), anti-ageing compounds, vitamins and other supplements in alternative acne treatment make skin pristine, add tone and improve texture.

"},{"title":" Acne and Diet - Insulin, Insulin Resistance, and Hormones ","word_count":444,"summary":" Find out why certain carbohydrates can make acne worse, and the impact of insulin on the male hormones that aggravate acne. It is thus evident that although diet may not directly cause acne, it does play a role, and can help in controlling acne. ","keywords":" acne and diet, acne, acne diet, acne nutrition ","article_body":" Diet, though not a direct cause of acne, does have an indirect effect on acne. That is why so many 'acne cures' recommend dietary changes in conjunction with whatever else they are advocating. Because diet has an indirect effect on acne, individuals will get variable results when changing what they eat. This is because we all metabolize foods differently. Some people may be more sensitive to certain foods, and so those foods will have a greater impact on their acne than others that don't have those metabolic issues. For example, skin with a tendency for acne has been shown to be insulin resistant. Insulin is a hormone that regulates carbohydrate metabolism, as well as playing a role in protein metabolism and fat metabolism. Insulin regulates the way our cells use the available energy in the bloodstream - so insulin makes the liver and fat cells (adipose tissue) take in some of the glucose in the bloodstream and stores it as fat. People with insulin resistance don't respond to the normal amounts of insulin released in the body. Because the regulation of blood glucose levels (which insulin ultimately is responsible for) is so important, the pancreas starts producing more insulin when the liver and fat cells don't respond. Blood glucose levels can build up if the body still doesn't respond. High levels of insulin can cause high blood pressure, fluid retention, and can lead to type 2 diabetes. Thus, for those with insulin resistance, poor quality carbohydrates such as white bread, sugar, and sugary foods, may be a problem. These types of carbohydrates are digested quickly and enter the blood stream rapidly. Normally, insulin would trigger the body removing those excess blood sugars into cells. But with insulin resistance, they hang around longer in the blood, as well as causing the body to have high levels of insulin in the blood. This is important for acne sufferers, particularly women, in that excess insulin can cause higher levels of male hormones. These androgen hormones have long been implicated in acne. They increase the oil production of the sebaceous glands, which leads to clogged pores and provides a breeding ground for the acne bacteria. In another study, researchers implicate the high levels of refined carbohydrates (such as bread and cereals) in teenage acne. Following a similar rationale, they suggest that high levels of blood sugars increase the levels of insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), which leads to excess production of male hormones. These male hormones then trigger acne outbreaks. And as well as that, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) encourages certain skin cells (keratinocytes) to increase. Keratinocytes are also implicated in acne.

However, it’s not something that cannot be tackled. There are loads of acne skin care products around. We can classify acne skin care products into 3 broad categories – 1. Preventive or general acne skin care products 2. Over-the-counter, specialised acne skin care products 3. On-prescription acne skin care products. The general acne skin care products are the ones that are used as acne-prevention measure. These include cleansers, make-up removers and similar products that help prevent acne. In the real sense, these acne skin care products are just those that should anyway be part of your daily routine. However, some of these are more oriented to act like an acne skin care product. These acne skin care products act against the causes of acne e.g. limiting the production of sebum/oil and preventing clogging of skin pores. Basically, these acne skin care products prevent the oil from getting trapped in pores and hence hamper the growth of bacteria that lead to acne. The general acne skin care products also include exfoliation products like skin peels. These work towards removing dead skin cells, hence reducing the possibility of pore-clogging and bacteria development. Then there are specialised acne skin care products that are available over-the-counter i.e. without the need of a prescription. These include products like vanishing creams which extract the extra oil from the skin. Most of these acne skin care products are based on benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, both of which are the enemies of bacteria (and hence acne). You should start with a product that has lower concentration of benzoyl peroxide (e.g. 5%) and see how your skin responds to it.  Alpha-hydroxy-acid based moisturizers are also popular as acne skin care products. You might have to try a few, before you zero-in on the acne skin care product that is effective for you. If nothing seems to work, you should contact a dermatologist. On-prescription acne skin care products are the ones that are prescribed by a dermatologist. This can include ointments that can be applied on the affected area or oral antibiotics or just any topical treatment. Dermatologist could also suggest a minor surgical procedure to remove the contents of pustules.  However, never try to squeeze or do this by yourself, it can lead to permanent damage of your skin.  Your doctor could also prescribe a hormone-based treatment (since hormonal changes are also known to cause acne). Such acne skin care products are known to be very effective in some cases. So, with all those acne skin care products, tackling acne is not that difficult.

This sebum keeps our skin well moisturized and protects skin from microbial infections. The sebum is mainly made of lipids and dead skin cells. The skin constantly produces the sebum. If you don't wash your hair for few days you will find that your hair is oily. That is sebum. What if your body produces more than required sebum? You get oily skin. Oily Skin- Why some people get it? Why some people have it? As we saw, the sebum makes the skin oily. Some of us have overactive sebaceous glands. That is mainly because of hormones that trigger excess sebum production. That is the reason many women get more oily skin during their menstrual periods. Apart from regular care of the oily skin, talk to your doctor about any method to control the androgens that trigger sebum production.

","keywords":" acne, acnes ","article_body":" Acne Acne is a common inflammatory skin disease that mainly affects the face, neck, chest and upper back. It is caused by an interaction between Hormones, bacteria and sebum produced by the sebaceous glands in the skin. Symptoms show as comedones (pimples), pustiles (lessions filled with pus) and occasionally Cysts. Acne is traditionally thought to developat Puberty but many women have acne throughtout life or it may develop in adulthood. It can develop premenstrually or may be associated with the talking or stoping of Oral Contraceptive Pills. This is possible caused by changing hormone levels. Treatment for acne depends on severity. Mild cases may be eased by washing the face with a gental toilet soap or by drying agents such as benzoyl peroxide. Severe acne may need oral treatment with antibiotics such as tetracycline or hormone therapy such as dianette, which also act as a contraceptive. Acne is the term for plugged pores, pimples, and even deeper lumps that occur on the face, neck, chest, back, shoulders and even the upper arms. No one factor causes acne. As physicians understand it, acne happens when oil (sebaceous) glands come to life around puberty, when these glands are stimulated by male hormones that are produced in the adrenal glands of both boys and girls. Welcome to Acne Treatment Care.com We have compiled and consolidated latest information on Acne, acne causes, acne treatment, acne symptoms with lots of home remedies for acne cure. Some Important Facts about acne * Anything that stimulates the growth of skin cells, such as scrubbing, can block ducts. You should simply wash the affected area with mild, un medicated soap once or twice a day, and dry gently. * Hot, humid weather causes skin cells to swell and thus increases the chance of blocked ducts. This is why face-steaming treatments are useless or even harmful. * Acne is definitely stress-related, so you are more likely to have a flare-up when you are under physical or emotional strain. * Some women notice an outbreak before periods, probably due to female hormones being converted in the body to male hormones. * You must avoid picking or squeezing, which may force more sebum into deep skin layers and increase inflammation. Fingers may also intro-duce infection. * Fresh air and a little exposure to the sun may help some acne, but too much sun causes skin inflammation, which worsens it. Sun should be totally avoided during some treatments your doctor, pharmacist or instructions with the medication will warn you about this. * Disguising an unsightly spot with a water-based cover cream will not aggravate the condition and is good for your morale. * Oily applications to affected skin usually worsen things. Very severe acne can be treated using a derivation of VITAMIN A, called tretimoin or Retin-A. This cream is applied each night and takes about 3 weeks to be effective. An oral version called Roaccutane is very good against severe acne but carries serious risks of foetal abnormality during PREGNANCY. This drug is carefully monitored for any side-effects in the patient but can be of considereable benefit, and the effects of treatment can last for a long time. Acne Treatment Care All acne can be improved, and sometimes it can be completely cleared up. Mild to moderate acne is usually remedied by over the counter pharmaceutical products that help to prevent blockage of sebaceous ducts. The manufacturer's instructions should be followed carefully. For more marked and persistent acne see your doctor, who may prescribe medication. Severe acne may need to be assessed by a dermatologist. You will not see the benefit of any treatment for about 6 weeks, so persevere and be patient. If there is no improvement after consistent use for 2 months, see your doctor again.

An estimated 20 million teens suffer from acne, but even the fact that they're not alone doesn't ease the pain they feel. Teens are embarrassed at a time when they are unsure of themselves. They may become depressed and withdrawn. Acne is especially hard on teenage girls. At a time when they're noticing boys, and visa versa, acne can be devastating. They're surrounded by visions of beauty all around them on TV, in movies, in magazines and on line. We live in a society that worships youth and beauty. Parents can help their teenage girls through this time by offering a supportive and sympathetic ear. Parents should help the child focus on all their positive attributes, which will help to strengthen the child's self esteem. The parents need to be actively involved with helping their child find the best possible cure for their particular form of acne. Parents should also educate themselves about acne causes and treatments. Thirty years ago it was thought that acne was caused by eating the wrong foods. Chocolate and potatoe chips were culprit. It's now known that this isn't true. Food is not thought to play a large role in acne. It also has nothing to do with cleanliness of the skin. What is fact is that acne in teenagers is caused by the action of hormones on the skin's oil glands. During puberty both boys and girls have an increase in the hormones called androgens. These hormones cause sebaceous glands under the surface of the skin to enlarge. The sebaceous glands in response produce excess oil. This excess oil mixes with bacteria and dead skin on the skin's surface and blocks pores. Inside these pores the bacteria multiple and cause inflammation. Most cases of light to moderate acne can be treated by over the counter medications. There are many to choose from. Some find that benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid works well. Benzoyl peroxide is known to readily kill acne bacteria. Benzoyl peroxide can be found in cleansers and in spot treatments. Benzoyl peroxide is very drying and can make your face look even more irritated, especially when you first start washing with it. Many acne suffers use a moisturizer on their face after washing. There are many moisturizers available that are specifically designed to help with acne such as Cetaphil, Eucerin, and Neutrogena. Severe acne, or acne that has not responded well to over the counter products, can be successfully treated with the knowledge and expertise of a dermatologist. A dermatologist will consider many things before suggesting treatment. He will perform a thorough evaluation of the patient, considering things such as severity of acne, patient age, lifestyle, and co-existing conditions. The dermatologist then may suggest a combination of two or three different therapies for best treatment. Whatever one of the literally hundreds of treatments you decide to choose, or if you seek the help of a dermatologist, remember that acne takes time to disappear. Overnight or miraculous results don't happen. It takes six to eight weeks to see results from treatment. Unfortunately, in a teenage girl's life six to eight weeks can feel like a lifetime.

No matter how people look at you & perceive your image, but all the grooming stuff you do is to look good. Everyone wants to portray him or herself as if no one was handsome or smarter ever. Especially people in showbiz and media in general are more conscious about their looks which builds up the self-regard in them is important than life. Similarly, for teenagers looks are even more important than the person inside. This twisted sense of self-image can backfire and lead to some truly horrible results. More and more teens are suffering from depression. Young girls seeking perfection can become anorexic or bulimic. Some kids even isolate themselves and are extremely uncomfortable in social situations. So when acne strikes, how are teens equipped to deal with the prospect of looking “abnormal” or “ugly”? Teenagers can be cruel to each other, and to themselves. The American Academy of Dermatology has reported that a staggering 95% of American teenagers will suffer acne breakouts at some point during adolescence. Some kids can hide milder cases with makeup or flesh-colored over-the-counter treatments. Some even use their hair or clothing – longer styles, hats, etc. However, sufferers of severe acne must stand exposed, with all their imperfections, for the world to see. Since acne occurs so frequently in adolescence, blemished skin makes teens fear how their peers view them. Self-esteem and self-worth can be affected when kids are afraid of being judged by their contemporaries. Teens put up with so many anatomical changes that can make them feel “dirty.” It is particularly vulnerable time when kids worry about being accepted, and about the way, they look. Unfortunately, some parents can trivialize the teen’s fears. Attitudes like “I went through it…you’ll go through it” and it will go away. However, when that first serious breakout happens…acne typically gets worse before it gets better…the teen may rationally agree that it is probably a passing phase. However, while it is “going away,” the teenager remains afraid of being judged by his peers, and serious self-esteem issues can result. These unsettling feelings about self-image can sabotage a young person already confused by this gateway to adulthood. This is a time in a teen’s life when he/she should get out and be involved in peer activities – but fear of being “different” is strong. Parental support can be vital at a time like this. Even when teen’s appear to “not need” your help, playing a gentle supportive role can help a budding adult’s transition.

Practical Acne Treatments For Girls… Proper skin care is the first step in dealing with acne.  There are many skin care products on the market that may help with acne.  Gently washing the face twice a day is the first place to start.  Be sure to select a cleanser that contains salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide or sulfur, as they kill the bacteria that cause acne.  Gentle cleansing is important so don't wash too often or scrub the face with harsh cleansers. It is also important to use non-comedogenic products when trying to control acne.  Non-comedogenic products are less likely to cause acne, blackheads or block the pores of the skin.   There are many non-comedogenic products available, such as makeup, moisturizers, lip stick, and even acne medicated makeup.

"},{"title":" Acne and Vitamin Supplements ","word_count":488,"summary":" For years, scientists, doctors, biologists, dermatologists, and dieticians have searched for and studied all of the various causes of acne. ","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" Since the majority of the worlds population suffer from acne at some point in their lives, there is no surprise that such efforts are invested in finding out how to it. While there have been some definitive answers on whether acne is hormonally induced (yes), and what can be done to prevent it (prescription drugs, certain herbal remedies, etc), there are still many unknown factors that cause acne. However, of all the many acne questions that science is yet to find answers to, the most controversial is whether or not diet has an effect on acne. Historically, diet was thought to be linked to acne. Doctors and housewives alike believed that a high fat content in ones diet would cause an oilier complexion, and this in turn would create acne breakouts. However, as time went on, science found no directly link between a diet high in lipids (fat), and acne. Since acne is caused by a bacterial growth in sebum trapped in clogged pores, there is no such thing as “extra oil secretion”. So, for at least the last 15 years, western medicine has claimed there is no connection between diet and acne. However, a study conducted in 1997 has rekindled the flame in the “diet causes acne” argument, and this time, with a bit more heat. This study, conducted by Dr. Lit Hung Leung, states that Acne breakouts are because the body cannot create enough of Coenzyme A to break down the fatty acids that create sebum. The reason is, Coenzyme A is probably the single most needed enzyme in the body. This Coenzyme-A is what synthesizes sex hormones, and what breaks down fatty acids. The only part of Coenzyme-A that the body does not produce itself is vitamin B5. So, if there is a shortage of B5, there is a shortage of Coenzyme-A. And if there is a shortage of Coenzyme-A, the body will use it to synthesize sex hormones, not break down fatty acids. So, you can see where this is going…more fatty acids, more sebum production, more acne. Now, the interesting thing is that Dr. Lit Hung Leung substantiated this claim by testing it on 100 people. The group took 10 grams or more per day of pantothenic acid ( B5 ), and used a B5 topical cream of 20% by weight. After 2-3, sebum production was reduced, and many people with acne noticed a reduction. For those with more extreme acne, a higher dosage of B5 was used (approx. 15-20 grams per day), and treatment was prolonged to see an effect, sometimes up to 6 months. So, while one study does not definitively prove whether B5 can prevent or reduce acne, it may well be worth considering, particularly for those who want a natural or herbal cure for acne, and do not want to use chemicals such as benzoyl peroxide, or other prescription acne treatments. As with any medical treatment, it is best to consult a doctor before trying a B5 regimine.

In addition to acne being a skin condition that is, to say the least, unpleasant, it also have social and emotional effect. This effect carries with it a multitude of psychological issues that change teens lives in different ways. When thinking back I remember my acne problem and very clearly remember that my friends and peers were not much of a help to me at those times. Society seems to react to this skin condition in the worst possible way, when the spirit of the teenager is at its most delicate phase. This is a prime reason to why many teens try and avoid social events, situation where they might be in danger of embracement over a skin condition on which they seemingly have no control. One big problem is that some people do not understand the acne problem for the mere reason that they never suffered from it, obviously this creates a terrible situation where the teen is not only ridiculed for the acne he suffers from, he gets this from others that very clearly do not have the problem. In more recent years, however, the problems faced by those who suffer from acne are being more widely addressed, and the social and psychological effects being studied more closely. Some will say that the problem is our society and the norms it sets, the definition of beauty or of health in certain ages and in certain cultures. In a society where so much importance is placed on appearance and complying to the \"norm\", higher standards have been set concerning what people do and don't accept. In the defining phase of his life, the teenager is extremely exposed to these social agreements and this creates problems with the understanding of the limits to improvement and the shame that follows lack of improvement. For teens this very important and sometimes even seem crucial. Many teenagers slowly get used to what other teenagers say about them and within a short period of time become very critical of their appearance and social possibilities, it is of course ridicules that a young man will judge himself for having a skin condition but this actually happens and even more, some teens begin to develop inner hate towards themselves – because of this social pressure. The best solution for explaining and combating acne and its social implications, it is recommended that a parent or a guide of some sort will explain to the teen that acne is caused by many different things, many factors contribute to the development of acne. In teens it is believed that hormones are the primary reason, hormones cause the body to produce excess oil, which in turn clogs pores and causes pimples. This kind of situation can be solved by regular acne treatment. The parent should also explain that eating certain foods and the way you clean your face also has little to do with the development of acne, reassuring the teen at this point is very important as he is very likely to be bombarded with exaggerated acne urban tales that create a feeling like everything the teen is doing is the cause of the acne, as if it was a curse he couldn’t shake.

While most people experience the brunt of acne during the difficult adolescent years, imagine the agony of living with acne well into your middle years.  With the stress of modern day living and increased exposure to environmental pollutants, adult acne is becoming a fact of life for many adults.  Although most people will only have to deal with transient acne, some will experience far worse.  Here is a quick run-down of the most serious forms of acne. Acne Conglobata (AC) This is a very uncommon form of acne that can produce significant disfiguration.  Acne conglobata is characterized by the development of burrows in the skin, along with papules, abscesses, keloidal and atrophic facial scars.  Individuals with AC often develop blemishes that appear in clusters of two or three.  Cysts are often present that are filled with pus. Nodules may also be present, especially in the area of the back and chest. Who is more susceptible to acne conglobata? In general, males are more likely to experience AC.  Onset of AC usually occurs at a young age, between the ages of 18 and 30.  Although no one knows the exact cause of AC, some believe it is caused by a mutation in the XXY karyotype chromosomes.  A person with AC may experience extensive scarring and subsequent disfigurement.  Because the effects of AC can often be dramatic, individuals afflicted with the skin disorder may be at greater risk of suffering from self-esteem issues, depression, anxiety, and they may feel stigmatized. Acne Fulminans (AF)  Acne fulminans, sometimes referred to as acne maligna, was originally thought to be acne conglobata (AC). The major characteristics of acne fulminans include sudden onset of ulcerating acne, which may be accompanied by fever and symptoms of polyarthritis.  Usually, AF does not respond well to conventional acne treatment, such as antibacterial therapy.  The most successful treatments appear to be debridement used in conjunction with steroid therapy. What causes AF?  It appears that acne fulminans is caused by a weakened immune system and increased levels of testosterone and certain anabolic steroids.  These high levels of hormones cause an increase in the production and excretion of sebum and the acne-inducing bacteria known as propionibacterium acnes (P acnes).  Some skin professionals believe that isotretinoin may also precipitate an eruption of AF. How can you tell the difference between acne conglobata and acne fulminans?  Although the physical symptoms may at first appear identical, AF is usually characterized by the presence of more physical pain.  Patients with AF may describe feelings of bone or facial pain, migraines, and fever.  Acne conglobata and acne fulminans also differ in the way they are treated.  While AC may be treated with conventional anti-acne oral and topical agents, AF typically does not respond well to such treatments.  AF responds better to steroid treatments. Gram-Negative Folliculitis Gram-negative folliculitis refers to an infection of gram-negative rods that usually occurs after an extended period of antibiotic therapy.  Scientists use the word \"gram\" to describe the blue stain that is used in laboratories. This is often used to locate microscopic organisms.  The bacteria that cause gram-negative folliculitis does not stain blue, thus the term 'gram-negative.'  The most common forms of bacteria that are believed to cause gram-negative folliculitis include E. coli, serratia marcesoens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteria's from the proteus and klebsiella species. How does gram-negative folliculitis differ from regular acne vulgaris?  Most cases of gram-negative folliculitis produce less papules and comedones than acne vulgaris.  Treatment of gram-negative folliculitis is fortunately much easier to treat than other severe types of acne.  In most cases, conventional antibiotic therapy will help clear up gram-negative folliculitis.  Isotretinoin may also help clear up this condition. "},{"title":" Acne at my age?

Now that your hitting the fabulous 40s, you should be coasting through life, right. Well, why are you suddenly dealing with the cosmetic double whammy of acne and wrinkles? Even your insurance company figures that you should have gotten rid of acne by the age of 25. The number people over 30 needing acne treatments has climbed to the extent that a report published in Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology recommends raising the age for insurance coverage of the acne drug tretinoin to at least 40. The authors of the report, Drs. Steven Feldman and Alan Fleischer, add that many insurance companies refuse to pay for tretinoin prescriptions for patients older than 25. Cosmetic Catch 22 Even if your insurance company leaves you to fend for yourself, you still have options for freeing yourself from acne and wrinkles. At first, coping with acne and wrinkles may seem like a cosmetic catch 22. Do you dry your skin with acne cleansers containing benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, and worsen your wrinkles? Or, do you smear on the moisturizer to smooth the wrinkles, but cope with the zits brought on by the extra oil or sensitivity to a new product? There’s a smarter way to handle acne and wrinkles. 1. Interpret the acne 2. Allow your skin to improve as you use self-awareness to remove zits. Interpret the acne While dealing with acne and wrinkles, target the acne first because acne is an autoimmune disease. Having an autoimmune disease means that your thoughts, emotions, and/or environment are affecting you in an adverse way and require immediate attention. Thus, acne may reveal that you need to relax more, change your eating habits, reframe your interpersonal dialogue, stop dating that jerk from the office and/or make another beneficial alteration to your lifestyle. Zits arrive on your face to report on some unpleasant activities within your body and life. Once you get feedback from these zits, you can take action to send the zits away while augmenting your health in the process. Acne is usually an indication various hidden or overlooked health problems. Here’s a sample of the questions you should ask yourself when dealing with acne so that you can unravel the mystery behind your zits. Are you Regular? About 70% of your immune system is located in your intestines. If this area is blocked with waste, your immuno-defenses are down. So, instead of waste leaving your body via the rectum, it chooses to leave through the skin. Waste leaving the skin can cause an infection that presents itself as acne. Tense? Tension likewise reduces the vigor of the immune system. Take a few deep breaths throughout the day to calm your body. Take a long walk in the fresh air to wind down. Eating nutritionally? Cases of acne have been improved with consuming foods containing zinc, essential fatty acids, vitamin A and a host of other nutrients. All of these vital nutrients are available in leafy green vegetables, fruits and olive oil. Worried about unresolved issues? Not resolving personal issues creates conflict and tension in the body. Again, these issues most be addressed to avoid undue stress within the body. Exercising daily? Exercise reduces stress and gives you an opportunity to subconsciously contemplate challenges that you may be facing. Physical activity also keeps your muscles and intestines toned, which keeps encourages regularity. Changing pillowcase frequently? Using a dirty pillowcase aggravates an acne condition. Your face naturally secretes oils during the night. These oils are sticky. So if you pillowcase if dirty, you are allowing your face to collect extra waste during the night, which could further clog your pores. Moving or changing your job/career? New demands or feelings of lose can sometimes accompany change. Transfer these emotions into something constructive by writing in a journal or envisioning how these changes are going to benefit you. Find comfort in these changes and opportunities for new beginnings. Experiencing excessive facial hair growth and erratic periods? Conditions such as acne, excessive facial hair, and erratic periods could indicate an androgen disorder or other underlying hormonal imbalances. Your doctor can provide you with a series of endocrine tests to ascertain your hormone levels and what corrective actions you should take. Ricardo Azziz, M.D, who serves as Chair of the Department of Obstetrics and Director of the Center for Androgen-Related Disorders at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, estimates that 80 percent of women with excessive androgen levels suffer from an endocrine disorder called polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Dr. Azziz adds that women with PCOS often have insulin resistance and are at increased risk for developing Type II diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. Once the acne is under control you can move on to the wrinkles. Another reason for treating the zits first is because if you alter your lifestyle in such as way as to free yourself from acne, and you doing this in a healthy and patient fashion, you will actually lessen the number of wrinkles you have. Health is wholeness and beauty is a reflection of robust health. You’ll never buy robust health in a jar. It is a mind, body, spirit and environmental support system that garners full-bodied health. Lets look at want you actually need from a “beauty cream”. Face Cream Education There are five basic ingredients in any given anti-aging or anti-wrinkling cream. 1. The oil or moisturizer 2. The preservatives to keep the cream from spoiling. 3. A scent or flavor 4. A color 5. The active ingredient. Only one of these components is essential, the oil. The preservative is only needed to keep the cream useful. Your face does not need preservation because the skin is alive. Since some people have allergies to scents and colors in cosmetics, the body says that these two ingredients are not necessary. The active ingredient is usually the latest cosmetic drug or multivitamin that is supposed to lift or dramatically reverse your age by 5-20 years. Researchers S. Jay Olshansky, Leonard Hayflick and Bruce A. Carnes bluntly comment on the antics of cosmetic companies in their report No Truth to the Fountain of Youth, published in the June 2002 edition of Scientific American. The authors warn everyone aiming to reverse the signs of times on their face that, “… anyone purporting to offer an anti-aging product today is either mistaken or lying”. I bet you are thinking, “Won’t that oil make acne worse?” The answer is not if you are using the right oil. Some essential oils such as bergamont, lavender, lemon, neroli, sandalwood, tea tree and ylang ylang have cleansing and antibacterial properties which help combat acne infections. Other essential oil like geranium, clary sage and orange regulate the production of oil on the face. When mixed with a carrier oil such as jojoba or camellia, these essential oils are ideal moisturizers. Nothing that you put on your face will truly change your appearance. Creams are useful, but they are only one instrument in an orchestra of anti-aging concerts. Health starts on the inside. If you want to improve your beauty start with how you treat yourself and feed yourself. I mean not only what foods you eat but what thoughts you eat. You may eat thoughts of the sort, “I can’t…”, “I had a stressful day”, “I’m tired of…”, “I can’t wait until…”, “I’m getting old”, “My body isn’t as healthy as it used to be”. The menu is endless. If you want to look young and healthy, you have to think young and healthy thoughts. Here’s steps to jumpstart your quest Start by changing your thinking. Develop your own youth model, i.e. with steps you’ll take to maintain your vitality and stick to it. Enjoy nutritious foods. A study in the Journal of American College of Nutrition found that eating a variety of fruits and vegetables and using olive oil every day could help keep wrinkles away. The researchers found that people who ate a diet rich in green leafy vegetables, beans, olive oil, nuts and multigrain breads, while avoiding butter, red meat and sugary goodies, were less predisposed to wrinkling. Researchers believe that antioxidant vitamins, such as A, C and E, which are found in fruits and vegetables, may help protect the skin from environmental damage. Use a gentle cleanser each day. Steam your face everyday for 5-15 minutes, especially if your have acne. The steam removes waxy build-up on the skin while it stimulates circulation. This combo of benefits cleans to pores to reduce the possibility of acne while firming up the skin and facial muscles. Exfoliate your skin daily. Moisturize your face in the morning and evening with natural oils. In addition to the acne fighting oils listed above, you can mix essential oils such as frankinsense, myrrh, neroli and rose to help encourage the growth of new skin cells. You can create a moisturizer by diluting 1-3 of your favorite essential oils in a carrier oil such as jojoba or camellia oil in a ration of 1 part essential oil to 3 parts carrier oil. Massage your face daily when you apply your facial oil. Lie down on an incline bench for 5-20 minutes each day to let the blood flow to your head. Wear a sunhat in the sun. Give yourself a light skin peel once a month. Finally, forty can still be fabulous and your beauty-plan a lot less enigmatic. Just remember the basics, interpret the messages of your zits, and educate yourself about wrinkle creams- you don’t need them. "},{"title":" Acne at this Age? But I’m no longer a teenager.

No, just about anyone susceptible to acne can suffer from it, especially if they suffered from it as teens. Therefore let’s see what we can do to prevent unsightly pimples even as adults. ","keywords":" Adult Acne ","article_body":" Contrary to some myths about acne, pimples are not for only teens going through puberty and hormonal upheaval. In spite of the fact that they may the highest percentage of the population that may have to cope with unsightly pimples, acne can affect just about anyone and speaking from personal experience, if left untreated or un-prevented, acne can be just as debilitating physically and emotionally on adults as it is for teens. Actually, adult acne may even be more devastating since there’s no excuse such as “it’s just puberty, you will outgrow it….” I guess all the people who tried to console me as a teen, who sadly had to deal with acne till I was about 22, were wrong. They meant well, but were still wrong. Now, adult acne plagues 25% of adult males and up to 50% of adult females, though it is often not recognized. Consequently, how to effectively control this predicament is obviously necessary. Although, conventional treatments of acne for adults and teens are what a good deal of the population turns to, based on my experiences and dare I say common sense, what worked for me was and is a natural acne remedy. Since treatment and control for adult acne does not differ drastically from that for teens, with drug-free healing, these simple steps could be used by anyone coping with acne problems. 1. First and foremost, I care not what some sites and product endorsers say about how diet doesn’t affect acne; you have got to make a change in your eating habits, plain and simple. You are what you eat. If you want to have clearer skin and the added bonus of improved health, of course eating right will be essential. That said Fruits and vegetables friends. Shop more in the produce aisle and steer clear of the snack stands at the cash register. It’s worth the sacrifice and this forms the basis of an internal acne treatment right there from its root cause. 2. For external acne-care, you could learn such simple tips as facial massaging and exercises. However, (now I’m speaking from what I went through and believe me I had acne BAD…) simply washing your face with nothing but clean hands and plain cool water may perhaps be the most efficient way to clean the pores. Combined with the facial massaging and occasional steaming of the face, this will be very sufficient to clean the skin. 3. Change your pillowcases daily and make sure you have a towel exclusively for your face or you could employ the use of paper towels. 4. If you use greasy hair-products, shampoo the hair before retiring or at least use a clean do-rag to hinder the introduction of oily substances to the pillowcase and inevitably your face while asleep. 5. On that subject, try to also sleep on the right side. Besides checking against contaminations getting on the face, this is great for the heart and lungs and allows for a better and restful sleep (which co-incidentally helps with controlling acne.) 6. For males, when shaving, shave in the direction of the hair-growth (mostly downwards) and for an after-shave procedure, look into face massaging and occasional facial steaming as well. 7. For females-Avoiding the use of elaborate and inadvisable makeup regimens is advised. Besides, the clearer your skin becomes, you will see less of a need to have to spend time using make-up. It’s safe to say most guys like you ladies- you know…natural. 8. Deal with stressful situations amicably. This is another topic into itself but briefly these work Proper diet (factor #1), proper thinking habits and exercise. For stress, allow me to mention Yoga-don’t have the space to explain why, but friends, with its sun-exercises and its derivative, Hindu push-ups, Yoga is awesome for stress-relief. Adult Acne can be frustrating and embarrassing, but with the steps above, take it from a guy who went through it and doesn’t anymore, you definitely will be on the path towards clearer skin. So empower yourself with the use of these tips to be free from adult acne starting today. In Friendship, Foras Aje "},{"title":" Acne- Can I Treat My Acne By Removing Surface Oils?

Unless your skin is oily, no drying will help. With oily skin also , one can only keep the skin dry, but can not treat acne by drying the skin. It may hurt you more. You can treat your acne in other easy ways. Here is how? Acne and Benzoyl peroxide- If you have only blackheads or whiteheads, there is nothing better than Benzoyl Peroxide. If that is not suitable for you try salicylic Acid formulations. These are OTC products and if you have patience, they will get rid of your acne. Don't squeeze out your acne. That will enlarge your pores and may scar. Let it dry with the formulations slowly and after some time some discoloration may remain that will go away. Acne and retinoids- For severe acne, get antibiotics and retinol creams. The antibiotic will stop the bacteria P.acnes from spreading and retinol will dry the skin and remove the block that is causing sebum to accumulate in your pores and causing acne. Acne and AHAs- AHA formulations loosen the dead skin cells and remove them. If you regularly use AHA formulations, your acne may never get a chance to form. Acne forms only if the gland is blocked. AHA opens the gland and may work as a good preventive. Please consult your doctor about the above options. This article is only for informative purposes.

If we have a lot of confidence we find it easier to do tasks such as finding work, friends, loved ones. It is a known fact that people that have a great deal of confidence do actually do better In life. They find it easier to talk to people which allows them to get what they really want. Having acne can completely ruin someone's confidence within themselves, If you doubt the way you look, you will mentally think about the way you look while you are talking to somebody. This may not be obvious to you but the person that you are talking to can sense that you do lack confidence and self esteem. One of the most important aspects for our life is to find someone to love and have a family, even if you didn't want a family and simply wanted a lot of love you would still need to attract someone. The way someone acts has 60% impact on actually finding a partner, the person doesn't have to be good looking the thing that attracts people to other people is confidence. Why Clear the acne? Simple! If you had acne you would be less confident than if you had a clear skin. Image walking into a pub, club or anywhere were a lot of people are that you find attractive. You would walk in and feel that you stand out because of your acne and they do not find you attractive. Now image that you have used a great product that removes the acne and clears the skin, simply image walking into the exact same place, the light shining of your clear skin. People still looking, but looking at how beautiful you look. Now just thinking of this you can see that you confidence can increase by just improving your skin. There is no \"Great\" product! WHAT!! There is a great product! I should know I have used it myself, I was once like you are now, I lacked confidence, I couldn't talk to anyone. The acne on my face simply stopped me from being able to talk and be the real me. I spent hundreds and hundreds looking for a product that would really do what I need, I asked doctor after doctor until I finally searched on the internet and found ClearPores. ClearPores is a acne product which is very unlike any other, this is what attracted me to the product. It is a 3 part system, the first part is a face wash (which makes sense, your not going to have clear skin without washing it) The second part was a protection cream to help protect it from bacteria within the air. The final part is a herbal supplement which kills the bacteria within the skin. This was it! The product I was looking for, I asked doctors about what acne is they told me but one thing they said that really stood out was the fact that Acne appears under the skin 2 weeks before it appears on the surface. 2 weeks!! This is when I remembered the clearpores product, it has that herbal supplement which helps kill bacteria before it surfaces. I brought the product, used it and now I have more confidence than I ever thought i would have. Acne ruins 70% of life's, don't be apart of that 70%! "},{"title":" Acne- Can You Stop Acne Formation?

For other adults suffering from acne, the outbreaks did not start until they reached their twenties. The causes of adult acne vary and can be any one or a combination of the following conditions. Stress Until recently, stress related acne was a myth. Researchers are now beginning to understand the correlation between stress and acne. For adult acne sufferers, stress is considered to be the leading cause to post-pubescent breakouts. When we are exposed to stressful situations, the brain triggers the central nervous system, which in turn sends signals to the rest of the body as part of a primitive fight or flight response. Part of this response is hormonal release from our adrenal glands and fatty secretions from the sebaceous glands, which lay beneath the skin. Both hormonal imbalance and fatty secretions, which can clog pores, are known contributors to acne outbreaks. Hormonal Imbalances Hormonal imbalances as a cause of adult acne primarily affect women. Imbalances that occur during a woman’s menstrual cycle or as a result of pregnancy can lead to acne outbreaks. There are adult males who report that they have monthly acne episodes. While men obviously do not menstruate, it is believed that men may have hormonal cycles similar to women. Coffee Consumption Adults tend to ingest more coffee than do teens. The caffeine in coffee and tea promotes the production of cortisol, which is also known as the stress hormone. As noted, hormone imbalances are known contributors to adult acne. Smoking The chemicals introduced into the body by cigarette smoking limit blood circulation to skin cells, inhibiting the skin’s ability to heal and regenerate. The toxins released in cigarette smoke can clog pores and promote bacterial growth in pores, all of which contributes to adult acne. Heredity Recent research has shown that people are more likely to suffer from adult acne if they have a family history of adult acne sufferers. Environmental Job conditions that expose the skin to high levels of pollutants, irritants, or humidity can lead to an increase in adult acne. Cosmetics • Poorly formulated cosmetics that are heavy or greasy can clog skin pores, trapping bacteria, dirt, and oils resulting in adult acne breakouts. Covering acne with makeup can make the condition worse. "},{"title":" Acne Care Skin Treatment ","word_count":561,"summary":" There are many possible causes for acne.

","keywords":" acne care skin treatment ","article_body":" There are many possible causes for acne.  People of all ages, lifestyles, and backgrounds can develop it, and the causes can be different for each.  The first step to understanding what is causing your acne is knowing your skin type and how to care for it.  If you have oily skin, you wouldn't want to use a facial cleanser containing oil because your body is already producing a good amount of it.  Likewise, if your skin is dry, you wouldn't want to necessarily use a product that is oil free.  Perhaps, one of the most common myths is that oily skin does not need to be moisturized.  Oil is not moisture, and skin needs moisture.  Determining the cause and caring for your type of acne, as well as properly caring for your skin is crucial in curing acne. This article covers some of the possible causes of acne and how to help determine what might be causing yours. The skin is the largest organ in the human body.  Like all other organs, proper care must be given to ensure it works correctly. Topical treatments are those used on the surface of the skin.  By helping to keep pores open, eliminating excess dirt and oil, and getting rid of unwanted bacteria, these may do the trick.  There are other medications that can be taken orally to help eliminate excess oils by keeping the body from producing it, along with various other medical remedies that help treat acne.  Before you can treat it, however, you need to understand what is causing it. Hormones can play a major part in causing acne.  In adolescence, the changes the body goes through can cause constant breakouts, while in adult years, bodily changes, such as premenstrual and pre menopausal episodes, can cause breakouts to continue.  While any hormonal excess can promote acne, the mail hormones are most notorious for doing so. The body can then produce more oil, which can block pores and cause breakouts.  Using products that help eliminate or control oil may be helpful in curing acne with this cause. Stress can also be a contributing factor to the presence of acne.  When you are stressed, the body releases certain hormones and chemicals which can produce toxicities that cause acne.  Try to eliminate stress by staying away from stressful situations. It is also believe that some foods, such as chocolate and sugar can cause acne.  While this is commonly disputed and often thought to be a myth, it is unclear whether these foods are unable to actually cause acne.  Ask a physician if you want to know more about this as a possible cause. Because there are many types of acne, there can be many causes.  Environment can influence acne, as well as lifestyle.  The products you use can also effect your acne.  If you are not using the proper products to counteract acne, you may see an increase in breakouts.  As mentioned above, if your skin is oily, you don't want to use products containing excess oil, as this would add to the oil on your skin and could clog pores and cause further breakouts.  It is also important to keep the skin properly hydrated and moisturized.  Learn how to care for your particular skin type and try to eliminate the factors that are causing your acne.  This will help you have healthier skin. "},{"title":" Acne Causes and Treatment ","word_count":414,"summary":" Acne is one of the most common skin problems affecting people worldwide.

Among the many causes are clogged pores resulting from makeup, everyday air particles and often a simple case of hormonal changes.  While acne is a part of life for many individuals, it can be effectively treated. One of the best natural remedies for acne is to wash your face at least twice on a daily basis.  Early in the morning and late at night are both good times to cleanse the face.  A moisturizing soap will be the most gentle for your skin whereas others with a harsh ingredient may strip the skin of it’s natural moisture and may even cause itching and/or redness. Many people choose to use retail acne treatment products, which can be effective if used properly.  It is very important, however, that consumers read and understand the instructions and/or warning labels found in the packaging.  All acne treatment creams, pads or face wash products should be kept away from the eyes and are for external use only.  This is not only true of retail products, but prescribed medications as well. For a recurring or severe case of acne, many sufferers turn to a dermatologist for a more aggressive treatment.  In most cases, a prescribed routine and medication can help to treat acne.  In most cases, a follow-up visit will be scheduled so that the doctor may monitor the patient’s progress and determine whether additional steps should be taken to treat the problem. It is very important to avoid aggravating, or disrupting, any and all acne blemishes.  Otherwise, the sufferer will face a possible bacterial infection from dirt and/or germs that may reside underneath the fingernail.  Many believe that just because their fingernails appear clean, there is nothing to worry about.  That’s simply not true.  There are many germs and bacteria, which are not visible to the naked eye, that reside underneath the fingernail.

Acne cleansers are facial care products designed to remove dead cells, open up pores, remove oil, dust, dirt and other harmful pollutants. Generally acne cleansers are used twice or thrice daily and in conjunction with skin toners and moisturizers. Acne cleansers work better than ordinary soap because soap has a very high pH value which can change the pH balance of the skin. The method to use acne cleansers is to use luke warm water to clean the face then apply acne cleanser all over the face and throat. Next it is to be washed with luke warm water and then patted dry. Acne lotions are oil and water emulsions designed to be applied on unbroken skin. Acne lotions are usually medicated with acne medicines like, antibacterials, skin exfoliants, retinoids or antibiotics. Acne lotions may contain soothing or protective ingredients also. Acne lotions have the advantage over creams or ointments as they can be applied thinly over a large area and hence can be economical. Acne creams are semi solid emulsions. Creams can be used as a barrier for protection, as a delivery vehicle for anti acne agents and to retain moisture in the skin. Acne cream ingredients may include anti acne agents, moisturizers, skin exfoliants etc Acne soaps are mild soaps used to open up the pores and remove oil in excessively oily skins. All the above products if used in conjunction with acne dietary supplements like acuzine produce good results. Acuzine consists anti-oxidants, vitamins E & C, hydrolyzed collagen, ALA, DMAE, Aloe vera, Bioperine etc. The presence of these ingredients helps in early recovery of the skin and provides vital vitamins and enzymes for rebuilding the skin.

It more often than not affects teenagers, but infants and adults are from time to time affected too. Undeniable reports have noted that acne can cause personal suffering and it may even lower the person’s self esteem.  In fact, of all its victims, many have found themselves ill at ease and dejected.  Having such kind of feeling, it is no wonder then that most of the acne patients respond to certain acne cures that will help make better their overall skin condition.  But, is there really an acne cure? For so many years, definite studies have been conducted for the cure of acne.  Until these days, there is no one meticulous magic acne cure that can totally get rid of acne, although some products are claiming that they can.  Nevertheless, the news is not at all bad since a number of acne remedies, known be many as acne cures, are now accessible on the market.  These acne cures largely vary according to the manner of application, the seriousness of the acne condition, and to the kind of the acne patient’s skin. One of the classically used acne cures are those over-the-counter products such as cleansers, moisturizers, astringents, and pimple creams.  These acne cures are actually non-prescription goods that are to some degree confirmed capable for unplugging the whiteheads and blackheads.  Some of these acne cures promote the skin to peel off, giving way to the new skin to renovate. The current antibiotics are also there, known as “prescription only” acne cures.  These forms of acne cure normally help fight acne by means of knocking out the acne-causing bacteria that contaminate the pores.  However, there are some instances that acne may become unaffected by  these forms of acne cure, turning them ineffective in the end.  It is also worth noting that topical antibiotics have certain adverse side effects that need to be considered before opting for one of them. Apart from the topical antibiotics, there are also oral antibiotics.  Perhaps one of the bad ideas about this form of acne cure is the fact that since they are taken orally, there is a great chance that will affect the total body, causing severe side effects in the end.   Amongst the many side effects of these acne cures, are nausea and dizziness. They are the most common. There are also some vitamin A derivatives out there that can help stop the cells in the skin from clumping together and encourage the skin to shed.  However, just like the above mentioned acne cures, these too have their side effects like emotional disorder, dryness, irritation, redness, and even birth defects. "},{"title":" Acne Cure For Sure!

But these things are so expensive and you don’t know if both will be successful. Here are some easy tips for acne cure and avoidance 1. Regular Exercise Regular exercise can help in acne cure by fighting off negative stress intensity that can come from negative confidence and depression. But avoid wearing tight nylon exercise outfits. These synthetic fabrics that tend to trap body moisture and heat, creating an ideal environment for bacteria to grow. Stick to loose clothing made of cotton or natural blends, and keep your sports gear and equipment clean. 2. Using Safe Cosmetics To avoid the clogging of pore and skin irritations that can contribute to acne, use products labeled \"oil-free\". Select \"hypo-allergenic\" perfumes and cosmetics to avoid allergic reactions and skin irritation. This may be the best acne cure for women. 3. Have a Healthy Diet What is best for your body is best for your skin. Don’t forget to eat the right kind of foods that are less in oil and carbohydrates Make sure you get enough vitamins and minerals that have been recommended to prevent and help acne cure. Some of these vitamins and minerals are Vitamin A or Retinol (High doses are toxic), Vitamin B Complex, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, L-Carnitine, and Zinc. Don’t forget to eat the right kind of foods that are less in oil and carbohydrates. 4. Drinking plenty of fluids Drinking plenty of fluids throughout the day helps cleanse our body internally. We know that acne cure can start from within. Fluids, especially water, can wash away the dirt inside our body. 5. Hormonal Treatments and Healthy Skin Regimen Hormones during later years, especially for women, can play a role in acne cure and prevention for teen years. For adults oral contraceptives or hormonal birth control pills may be helpful for women, combined with systemic or current treatments, prescription or over-the-counter medicines. Avoiding harsh scrubbing or over-washing is a good acne cure, because this can cause possible skin irritation or possible over production of oil to replace what's washed off, clogging pores in the process. Use products with gentle exfoliation ingredients and skip products that contain alcohol. 6. Shaving Shaving is actually an excellent way of exfoliating or removing dead skin to help acne cure and prevention instead of leaving the remains to clog pores. Shaving can help remove whiteheads and blackheads from the face. Do not shave areas that are sore or infected. Use a shaving cream for sensitive skin. Gentle swipes instead of heavy pressure and go with the flow or \"grain\" will be good for the skin. A single-edged blade is better than a twin-blade razor. 7. Stress Stress includes external and internal stressors. External Stressors are those that compromise your skin's ability to heal, like oily make-up and too much sun. Internal stressors like worry, fear, low self-esteem, depression and a variety of other emotions, can trigger chemical reactions inside your body that can result in acne outbreak and other skin irritations. To combat internal stressors and prevent acne problems, get plenty of rest and sleep. Try to maintain regular hours. These are just some ways of acne cure that can help prevent acne outbreak in teens and adults. Always remember that healthy living is the key for a healthy skin.

","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" Unfortunately, few find it, but this is only because they haven't found the right acne cure for them. Each of us is different, and our bodies function and respond to treatment differently. What works for some, may not work for others. However, there are a few proven treatments that do provide an acne cure for a large majority of acne sufferers. The best over the counter acne cure seems to be ProActiv. This is a skin care system that contains benzoyl peroxide as the active ingredient. It is an expensive treatment, but that is because it has proven to be so effective as an acne cure. ProActiv is a non-prescription topical acne treatment, with prescription strength benzoyl peroxide. Accutane, which is a prescription medication, has also proven to be quite effective as an acne cure. However, it is also expensive, and as an oral medication, there is the possibility of serious side effects. Due to the possible side effects, many choose not to take this powerful drug, even though it works well for the majority of people who use this treatment. Another acne cure seems to be retin-a. Retin-a is used to treat acne, acne scars, wrinkles, skin discoloration, and other skin disorders. It is highly effective, with few side effects. Retin-a is used as a topical treatment, and is available by prescription. However, there are other over the counter medications that contain small amounts of retin-a. The important thing to remember is that acne cures do not work overnight. Furthermore, you may need to continue acne treatment even after the acne has cleared up, or start the treatment again should you have another outbreak in the future. Discuss the need to continue treatment with your dermatologist. The three acne cures discussed above are expensive. However, they are expensive because they work. This doesn't mean that all expensive treatments work, it simply means that these three, which have been proven to work for the majority of people who have tried these treatments, are well worth the cost. Acne Myths Myth #1 Acne is caused by poor hygiene. If you believe this myth, and wash your skin hard and frequently, you can actually make your acne worse. Acne is not caused by dirt or surface skin oils. Although excess oils, dead skin and a day's accumulation of dust on the skin looks unsightly, they should not be removed by hand scrubbing. Vigorous washing and scrubbing will actually irritate the skin and make acne worse. The best approach to hygiene and acne Gently wash your face twice a day with a mild soap, pat dry--and use an appropriate acne treatment for the acne. Myth #2 Acne is caused by diet. Extensive scientific studies have not found a connection between diet and acne. In other words, food does not cause acne. Not chocolate. Not french fries. Not pizza. Nonetheless, some people insist that certain foods affect their acne. In that case, avoid those foods. Besides, eating a balanced diet always makes sense. However, according to the scientific evidence, if acne is being treated properly, there's no need to worry about food affecting the acne. Myth #3 Acne is caused by stress. The ordinary stress of day-to-day living is not an important factor in acne. Severe stress that needs medical attention is sometimes treated with drugs that can cause acne as a side effect. If you think you may have acne related to a drug prescribed for stress or depression, you should consult your physician. Myth #4 Acne is just a cosmetic disease. Yes, acne does affect the way people look and is not otherwise a serious threat to a person’s physical health. However, acne can result in permanent physical scars--plus, acne itself as well as its scars can affect the way people feel about themselves to the point of affecting their lives. Myth #5 You just have to let acne run its course. The truth is, acne can be cleared up. If the acne products you have tried haven’t worked, consider seeing a dermatologist. With the products available today, there is no reason why someone has to endure acne or get acne scars.

","keywords":" acne cyst ","article_body":" Copyright 2006 Robert Groleau Acne is a skin ailment that affects millions of people at some point in their life.  Over ninety percent of the world’s total populace is affected by acne with a immense number of teenagers.  Just like some skin disorders, acne varies to a great extent from mild to severe typically characterized by the incidence of pimples, blackheads, and acne cyst on the face, neck, chest, and back. When it comes to acne cyst, it is significant to note that it is in reality the outcome of the bacterial infection of cysts itself deep within the skin.  The acne cyst, in contrast to the blackheads and whiteheads, is generally huge inflamed lesions that are filled with pus.  A concrete reason for its expansion lies on the idea that when the contents of a clogged pore seeps into the skin, a major local immune response is produced.  Acne cyst may look like a nodule, and perhaps the only difference between them is that an acne cyst is pus-filled.  It is also worth noting that acne cyst typically have a diameter of 5mm or more across.  And, acne cyst is just one of the few signs of severe acne that it can be painful and can cause scarring if treated unsuitably. Acne cyst can be treated and prevented.  A number of ways to fight acne cyst and its scarring are in fact there.  But of all the approaches, conceivably the best way to treat and prevent ace cyst from forming is in essence not to squeeze, pick or pinch the lesions as it may only cause a deeper infection and much painful inflammation, which may last longer than if you had left it alone. Basically, an acne cyst is treated with oral and topical antibiotics for these greatly combat acne and acne scarring from forming.  In the case of modest to severe acne cyst, the therapy usually relies upon the antibiotherapy that will get rid of the microorganisms like the propionibacterium spp that has been colonizing the sebaceous follicles in the skin. An acne cyst can also be treated with certain bacterial resistances against certain antibiotics.  This is essentially a new trend in the medical field that it emerged just lately.  With its introduction, many experts have noted that both the antibiotic and its administration modalities must be addressed so to control the threat of having an acne cyst.  One tangible example of this kind of treatment is the oral minocyclines as they are powerful anti-acne therapies.  A number of treatments are actually now available on the market, but for a much better result, it is prudent to see your doctor first before opting for one of them.

","keywords":" acne ","article_body":" Deep cysts, inflammation, extensive damage to the skin and scarring characterize severe acne. It often requires an aggressive treatment regimen and should be treated by a dermatologist. Severe forms of acne can require years of treatment and may experience one or more treatment failures. However, almost every case of acne can be successfully treated. There are five popular treatments for acne cysts. There are many effective treatments that are available currently. Drainage and surgical excision, inner lesion corticosteroid injection, isotretinoin (a potent drug for treating severe cystic acne), oral antibiotics, and oral contraceptives are the most popular treatments. Some people may choose a more natural treatment for severe acne, which will also be covered briefly in this article. Drainage and extraction, or acne surgery as it is also called, should not be performed by patients and is used on some large cysts that do not respond to medication and require drainage and extraction. Dermatologists are trained in the proper technique and perform acne surgery under sterile conditions. Patient attempts to drain and extract acne cysts, by squeezing or picking, can lead to infection, worsening of the acne and scarring. When an acne cyst becomes severely inflamed, there is a good chance it will rupture and scarring will occur. To treat these severely inflamed cysts and prevent scarring, dermatologists may inject such cysts with a diluted corticosteroid. This lessens the inflammation and promotes healing of the acne cyst. An inner lesion corticosteroid injection works by melting the cyst over the course of a few days. Isotretinoin is the most effective treatment known today for severe acne and acne that is resistant to other medications and treatments. Isotretinoin is a form of vitamin A, a synthetic creation, which comes in a pill form. It is administered once or twice a day for anywhere from sixteen to twenty weeks total. There are many possible side effects that may occur while undergoing this therapy. Possible side effects include severe pain in the chest or abdomen, trouble swallowing or painful swallowing, severe headache, blurred vision or dizziness, bone and joint pain, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea or rectal bleeding, depression, dryness of the skin, eyes and nose, and thinning hair. While taking isotretinoin patients are monitored closely by their healthcare provider through follow up appointments. Oral antibiotics have been a basis of therapy for severe acne for many years. Like topical antibiotics, oral antibiotics work to reduce the \"P. acnes\". \"P. Acnes\" are normal residents on the skin, which decreases inflammation. Treatment with oral antibiotics usually begins with a high dosage, which is eventually reduced as the acne resolves. Over time, the \"P. acnes\" bacteria can become resistant to the treatment. When resistance occurs, another antibiotic can be prescribed or other treatment options may need to be explored. Oral contraceptives have been shown to effectively clear acne in women by suppressing the overactive sebaceous glands. Oral contraceptives can be used as long-term acne therapy; however, this medication should not be prescribed to women who smoke, have a blood clotting disorder, are older than thirty-five or have a history of migraine headaches, without the advice of a gynecologist. Spironolactone, a synthetic steroid, may be used in combination with oral contraceptives to treat acne in adult females. Spironolactone inhibits androgen, hormones that stimulate oil glands in addition to other effects on the body, production. There are possible side effects that may accompany Spironolactone treatment. A few side affects include irregular menstruation, breast tenderness, headache and fatigue. Some people choose more natural ways to combat cystic acne. Some natural treatments are eating a whole foods diet that consists of only natural foods that have not been chemically or mechanically processed. Yoga or deep relaxation techniques may be used to reduce the amount of stress that is put on the body and the mind. Essential oils are another natural treatment that may be added to the diet of sufferers of severe acne. These are just a few of the natural methods of treatment for cystic acne. No matter what method of treatment you decide to try you should always consult a professional, whether it is your dermatologist or an herbalist. Your doctor should be able to refer you to a board certified dermatologist if needed. "},{"title":" Acne- Do Miracle Cures Work? ","word_count":374,"summary":" Acne is a frustrating condition.

Many of us believe that acne can be treated by getting exposed to sun, but is it true? Let us find out the truth. Acne- causes Once we know about what causes acne, we can find out if sunshine affects any of them. The causes of acne are very simple. Because of hormonal changes and sometime pressure or chemicals, body produces more sebum. The gland keeps on producing sebum, but the gland opening gets closed with dead skin. This makes the gland expand like a balloon. The bacteria P.acnes infects the gland and inflames it. This gland forms the acne. If the infection is not severe you will call it black head or white heads, otherwise pimples, cystic acne etc. Acne - treatments- Every acne treatment tries to address one or more of the causes of acne formation. Sunlight does not address any of the causes. What it does is to either burn the skin or tan it. With tanned look, acne looks less apparent and we believe that it is going away. But that is not true.

The gland is full of sebum and the gland is clogged. If treated at this stage, the acne will resolve easily without any scar. But many times it gets infected and becomes a big pimple full of pus. Stop that happening with these easy steps. Acne- how it gets infected? A bacterium called P.acnes lives on our skin. Normally this bacterium makes no harm to us. If this bacterium is given a warm close place full of sebum, it loves that and multiplies there. This happens in acne. The sebaceous gland is the ideal place for the bacteria in acne and the bacteria multiplies inside that. When white cells kill the bacteria, you see the pus filled acne. We should stop giving the bacteria a place to thrive. Let us see how. 1. Treat the blackheads and whiteheads immediately with either Benzoyl Peroxide or Salicylic Acid. They will both unclog the gland. Consult your doctor about using tretinoin at this stage itself. Use AHAs around the affected area to remove dead cells faster and remove the top affected layer of the skin. Your doctor will draw a treatment program for you. 2. Ask your doctor if you can use a mild antibiotic along with other topical treatments to kill the bacteria before it grows. Kill all the bacteria before it multiplies. Generally we use antibiotic after getting infected. In this case, ask your doctor if you should use one as preventive. 3. Keep your hands clean and wash your face with a good acid balanced cleanser or an AHA based cleanser. Don't over clean the skin. Clean it two to three times a day. Don't touch the spots. That may infect them. Trying to remove the comedones may also infect them. Consult your doctor and if needed he/she will pull it out.

Acne are referred as Youvana pitikas (which means the eruptions of youth) in ayurveda. This shows the prevalence of acne from ages. Ayurveda has described the causes of acne and recommends the best natural herbal acne remedies too. What causes acne? A large number of oil producing glands called “sebaceous glands” are present under the skin  on face, back, chest and shoulders. During puberty or menopause due to the influence of the sex hormones, which are produced in male and female, these glands become more active and produce an oily secretion called “sebum”. The sebum makes the skin more oily .The excessive sebum clogs the skin pore or the pit of the hair follicle forming acne.The blocked pore or acne acts as an excellent habitat for bacteria. The bacterial infection causes inflammation (red, painful swelling of the infected area) of the clogged pore or hair follicle leading to eruption of pimples. Vata and Kapha are two main doshas, which are involved in eruption of acne and pimples. Rakta dhatu or blood also plays an important role in formation of acne. Vata when gets vitiated due to unhealthy diet and lifestyles affects other two doshas (kapha and pitta) to aggravate them. Aggravated pitta affects rakta dhatu or blood. The vitiated blood affects the skin and causes excess secretion of oil from sebaceous glands. Kapha has sticky property. The aggravated kapha imparts the stickiness to the oil produced by sebaceous glands of skin. Thus the  thick sebaceous plugs are formed in skin pores and hair follicles leading to eruption of acne.

No one is really sure what causes acne, or why it is known to form in the teen years. Although scientists don't know what causes it but heredity is at the top of the list of possible factors. Heredity has long been thought to be a large roll in who gets acne. If someone in your family has had, or has, acne, then you are more then likely going to develop it. Acne can vary from mild to very severe. It is commonly formed when the skin ducts and oil glands start to work overtime. The lining of the duct will actually shed cells which are then moved away to the outside layer of skin. The skin duct clogs and oil is trapped underneath. This plug of the pore is called a comedo. When the plug is below the skin it is called a whitehead, or closed comedo. But then, if the plug pushed up and pops out of the skin duct, pore, it is then called an open comedo, or blackhead. It is called black head because the top of it appears dark, although it is not dirt that is trapped in your skin, and it cannot be easily washed away. It is important that you do not let having acne restrict or control your life. Here are some tips for and easy Acne Free Treatment. One of the most dismissed treatments for acne is water. Something so easy as drinking enough water a day is very effective in getting rid of acne. This is thought to be because water is alkaline, with a pH of 7.3, and is considered a natural treatment to become acne free. Drinking at least eight glasses of water a day will help your body get rid of oil and waste toxins that can damage your skin.  Water even helps moisten your skin and keep your pores from clogging. Drinking water will also lower your stress levels and relax your body, letting you get a better sleep. Along with drinking more water, try to lessen your intake of coffees, sodas, teas, and alcohols. These types of drinks are diuretics that take more water out of your cells then they put in. Although astringents shrink your pores and decrease the appearance of acne for a short while, they are unhealthy for your skin in the long one. For one, they dry out your skin, forcing your cells to produce more oils, and that can lead to acne outbreaks. Also, when your pores shrink, oil is trapped in there, clogging the pores. Another thing to avoid is stimulants. Stimulants such as coffee, tea, cigarettes, and sugar from sweets and soda should be considered unhealthy for the entire body. These stimulants affect the whole nervous system and brain, and can easily stimulate the oil glands to start producing more oil than usual. These can also trigger stress, which is also bad for your skin. Watching what you eat is a good way to limit your acne breakouts. Diet does affect acne, so be careful what you eat. Try to stay away from foods that are high in fat, or foods that tend to be greasy. Think low fat foods and you will be just fine. Alcohol is thought of as one of the best ways to relieve stress, alcohol is also a big contributor to acne. It is an astringent and shrinks pores. Also, alcohol inhibits sleep and can cause stress. You need rest and a stress free lifestyle to have healthy skin. Scrubbing your skin, along with abrasive soaps should be avoided. They irritate the skin and damage the natural barrier between you and the acne causing bacteria. Sure, the sun does kill most bacteria, but it also harms the skin. The skin is very fragile, and is harmed easily. The sun acts as an astringent that tightens and clogs the skin pores. It also dries out the skin, and there is also sun spots, freckles, and skin cancer. You should spend 15 minutes under the sun daily. There are many medicines and cream that are used to fight acne. But so far, maintains a healthy lifestyle is the easiest way to go. It is important to say that by leading a healthy lifestyle, you will not only get healthier skin, but also a healthier body. Changing habits will be hard at first, but in the long run you will have a better general health, and more energy, and clearer, healthier skin. "},{"title":" Acne Getting You Down? The Future of Acne Treatments Looks Bright with New Laser Therapies ","word_count":432,"summary":" With technology, acne treatments are getting better and better. With the new laser therapies, acne treatments are now more accurate. ","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs, pimples, PIMPLES ","article_body":" Acne is a chronic inflammatory disease of the sebaceous hair follicles. Each follicle contains a tiny hair and multiple sebaceous glands. Under normal circumstances, sebum, the oily substance made by the sebaceous glands, travels up the hair follicle and out to the skin’s surface. However, with acne, sebum is trapped within the follicle and skin bacteria multiplies within the clogged pores. Acne develops on those areas of the skin where sebaceous glands are most numerous the face, scalp, neck, chest, back, and upper arms and shoulders. Acne typically begins in adolescence, although onset in the twenties or thirties is common. One approach to treating acne is to target the bacteria that produces the inflammation associated with acne known as Propionobacterium Acnes, or P. acnes. P. acnes releases porphyrins, which are naturally occurring molecules in the body. When porphyrins absorb certain wavelengths of light, free radical damage is produced which destroys the bacteria. Porphyrins absorb light best in the blue wavelength range – 400 nm to 430 nm. A low intensity blue light source (405 nm to 420 nm) has been studied for the treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory acne. In the study, two 15-minute exposures a week for a period of four weeks produced a 60 percent reduction in acne in 80 percent of patients. Reported remissions from acne lasted as long as three to eight months. Another way to treat acne using laser technology is to damage the sebaceous glands by a thermal or heat effect. In a recent study, a 1450 nm diode laser was used to perform four treatments one month apart. There was 100 percent clearing of acne in 16 of the 17 patients evaluated six months after the last treatment. Skin biopsies performed immediately after treatment showed heat-induced alterations of the sebaceous glands, reducing the amount of oil produced. \"While lasers have been used successfully for acne scarring for years, their use in actually controlling existing acne is a major breakthrough and could be an excellent alternative for those patients who have had minimal success with traditional therapies,\" explained by a dermatologist. \"However, this treatment is still investigational and not widely available yet. So not all patients will have access to it and the procedure is not covered by insurance.\" Patients need to be aware that many states do not distinguish who can and cannot perform procedures with laser/light sources. \"Since skin treatments using lasers can carry potential side effects, they should be performed by a qualified physician or under direct physician supervision. I encourage patients to ask their physician questions about who will be performing laser surgery, including their qualifications,\" cautioned by the dermatologist.

Instead of having you dig deeper into your pocket for various types of expensive acne treatment remedies, you should, initially, attempt to fight acne naturally by avoiding clogging your pores. The problem is a lot of people aren't aware of natural acne treatments. I found that when acne broke out on my face the most effective method at the time was to gently, and I repeat - gently - wash the acne area twice a day with warm water and soap. I tried to be proactive in my acne treatment. When that didn't work, I visited my doctor, who prescribed me various acne treatments, many of which had varying degrees of success. Physically it is difficult to cleanse and apply back acne treatments; treatment of back acne needs special care as it mostly gets noticed in acute stages. Just like with any other form of acne, the right treatment for back acne is not easy to find. All home made acne treatments should be strictly followed for over a period of time. As you can see, even with prescriptions, it takes time for acne treatments to take effect. Zinc has shown remarkable results in clearing acne. Acutance is one of the most potent conventional acne remedies ever developed that virtually eliminates your problem. Bergamot oil is one of many acne remedies that have been around for a long time.

Avoid oily cosmetics or any facial products that contain socetyl stearate, isopropyl isostearate, isopropyl palmitate, isopropyl myristate, parabens and sodium chloride, as these ingredients can cause acne.

Occasionally, acne vulgaris is accompanied by other bothersome skin conditions. ","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" Some are simply unpleasant tagalongs, like dandruff; some may actually be mistaken for acne, but require a different course of treatment. Of course, only your dermatologist can make a conclusive diagnosis. But learning a little about these conditions may help you formulate questions for your doctor. Acne cosmetica. As its name suggests, this mild and relatively common form of acne is caused by cosmetics. Since it's triggered by topical products, it can strike anyone — even people who are not physiologically prone to acne. It typically consists of small, itchy or rashy pink bumps on the cheeks, chin and forehead, developing gradually over the course of a few weeks or months. It may persist indefinitely, but usually does not cause scarring. How can you avoid it? When shopping for make-up and skin products, look for products that are \"non-comedogenic.\" These products are less likely to cause irritation or clogging of the pores. Dandruff (or Seborrheic Dermatitis). For reasons we don't know, dandruff often accompanies acne, especially in adolescents. The causes are similar. For dandruff sufferers, the natural process of scalp-cell renewal is accelerated when fighting off P. ovale, a normal fungus found on every human head. This causes dead cells to slough more quickly, creating the symptoms we know as dandruff — flaking, scaling and itching of the scalp. In some cases, dandruff involves tiny pimples on the scalp. Climate, heredity, diet, hormones and stress can also impact dandruff. Most cases can be managed with non-prescription shampoos containing zinc, coal tar or salicylic acid. Stronger shampoos can be prescribed by your doctor if the problem continues. Dandruff isn't caused by overwashing of the hair, so it's okay to shampoo every day. In contrast, scratching or picking the scalp can worsen the condition. Dermatitis (or Eczema) is characterized by a rapidly spreading red rash which may be itchy, blistered and swollen. Atopic dermatitis is related to asthma and hay fever-type allergies, and is often seen in early childhood. Contact dermatitis is usually caused by contact with irritants (detergents or harsh chemicals) or allergens (substance to which the patient is allergic, like rubber, preservatives or a particular fragrance). Individuals with chronic dermatitis will have a longstanding history of irritation in the affected area or areas. The eyelids, neck and hands are most commonly affected in adults. The skin in these areas may be darker than surrounding skin, and thickened from persistent scratching. This form is thought to be hereditary, but may be influenced by environmental factors as well. Dermatitis may come and go throughout a person's life. Enlarged pores. Before the onset of puberty, most people have relatively small pores and smooth skin. Pores tend to become larger in adolescence as sebum production increases. Then, as we continue to age, sun damage decreases the skin's elasticity, making pores appear larger. As an adult, the size of your pores is determined by genetics; some people retain the small pores of their youth, while others develop larger pores. Individuals with larger pores may complain of small grayish blackheads on the nose and cheeks. Contrary to popular belief, these \"blackheads\" are nothing more than normal sebum doing its job lining the pore. Since the sebum is meant to be there, squeezing is an exercise in futility — the oil comes back the next day, and frequent handling over time may actually damage the pore, causing it to enlarge permanently. Epidermal Cysts. Unlike cystic acne, which occurs within the confines of an infected follicle, an epidermal cyst is a sac-like growth in the deeper layers of the skin. The cyst sac is filled with a soft, whitish material that may remain indefinitely. Small cysts (less than 5mm in diameter) don't usually need treatment; they can be a nuisance, but are generally harmless. Larger cysts have a higher probability of becoming infected; this is very painful and can lead to scarring. Epidermal cysts are often permanent; even if the material is extracted, the sac remains and the cyst may return. In these cases the entire cyst sac must be excised to prevent recurrence. While cysts are typically benign, it's wise to consult a physician about suspicious lumps and bumps. Favre-Racouchet Syndrome. Because this condition is caused by severe, progressive sun damage over the course of many years, Favre-Racouchet Syndrome is most prevalent among men and women over 50. Patients are afflicted by large coalescent comedones (blackheads) around the eyes and on the upper cheeks. Unlike acne blackheads, Favre comedones do not regress if left untreated; they must be surgically extracted or treated with topical retinoids. Keratosis Pilaris. Common among teenagers, keratosis pilaris is characterized by patches of tiny, red, kernel-hard bumps on the backs of the arms, shoulders, buttocks and the front of the thighs. Occasionally it occurs on the cheeks as well, with numerous bumps in the affected areas. Unlike acne, keratosis pilaris is usually painless and feels spiny to the touch. It tends to be more severe during the winter months when humidity is lower, and is more prevalent in arid climates. Milia. These tiny, white bumps are found mostly in the area around the eyes. Cystic in nature, they are hard to the touch and deep in the skin. Milia may last for weeks or even months; if they are particularly troublesome to you, consult your dermatologist for professional, safe removal. Peri-Oral Dermatitis. Primarily affecting women in their 20s and 30s, this condition is characterized by patches of itchy or tender red spots around the mouth. The skin bordering the lips may appear pale and dry, while the chin, upper lips and cheeks become red, dry and flaky. It can also affect the skin around the nose. Pseudofolliculitis barbae. Pseudofolliculitis barbae is just a fancy name for the acne-like breakouts commonly called \"shaving bumps.\" As hairs begin to grow back after shaving, waxing or plucking, they get trapped inside the follicle and cause irritation and swelling. Not everyone gets shaving bumps; people with curly hair are more susceptible, but anyone can take steps to prevent them. If you can, use an electric razor. If you prefer blade shaving, use a new, single-edge blade every time you shave. Prep the area with warm water and use a rich shaving cream. Always shave with the grain, not against it. Then, after you're done, apply a mild toner or antibacterial gel. Get more information on shaving. Rosacea. Frequently mistaken for acne, rosacea is a skin condition most commonly found in adults between 30 and 60 years of age. Unlike acne vulgaris, rosacea does not involve comedones, and appears only in areas that are likely to flush when we're embarrassed, excited or hot — primarily the face, neck and chest. The skin is bumpy, red and oily in appearance, and may also involve papules and pustules. Rosacea begins as an episodic inflammation, or a temporary annoyance. Left untreated, however, it can become a chronic condition, causing facial scarring. If you think you may have rosacea, it's best to contact a dermatologist right away.

Adults have a wrong notion that it is the teenager's malady only. It is not so. The prime reason of its occurrence, as quoted by Acne scientists and researchers, is that the skin pores get clogged causing the accumulation of fatty material from the oil gland or sebaceous gland. Do all the pores get affected by acne? No! Why? The reason is not known. Scientists and the researchers are on the job. Much is said and written on the subject of acne. But they are as unreliable as the myth- mongers. Only they claim their scientific right to revise their earlier 'unassailable scientific findings', which become their new truth. Remember, someone else is busy in another laboratory, to negate the former version about acne. The difference between the researchers and the myth-mongers is that the former get paid for their findings, whether assertion or denial, and the later are left high and dry.

Research is continuing around the world to find acne treatments that can treat acne at the initial stage. At the later stage of acne growth, the chances of acne scarring become very high and therefore scientists are devoting efforts to treat acne painlessly at the beginning itself. The following are the latest treatments for acne that are being used to get clear skin. Blue Light- P.acnes bacteria is responsible for inflammation in the sebaceous glands causing acne. Blue light of low intensity destroys this bacterium. This is a painless procedure, which normally lasts for fifteen minutes per sitting. The interval of days for each treatment may vary and will depend on your doctor. Some side effects such as swelling, dryness and pigment change may occur because of blue light. By killing the bacteria, blue light treats acne quite painlessly. Green-yellow light and heat energy- this combination of pulses of green-yellow light and heat energy is supposed to kill the P.acnes bacteria and shrink sebaceous glands. By shrinking the glands, sebum production decreases.with reduction in sebum, acne shrinks and dries out. It is the sebaceous gland that is the place where acne forms. By shrinking it, sebum production decreases and acne formation reduces. Diode laser- this laser can destroy the sebaceous glands. Diode laser does not harm the outer layer of the skin. This kind of treatment can be painful and can create redness that is temporary and can also produce some swelling that is also temporary. The pain of laser can be reduced with application of anesthetics on the skin during the treatment. By destroying the sebaceous glands, acne can be controlled effectively. Microdermabrasion and chemical peeling- these treatments can be used to treat acne with other traditional therapies. Both these procedures are used to remove the dead skin, open the pores and accelerate growth of new skin. Traditionally these procedures have been used to remove scars, sun damage, fine wrinkles etc. They are now being tried to treat acne. This article is only for informative purposes.

","keywords":" ","article_body":" Acne forms near the opening of the sebaceous glands that have hair follicle in them. In normal circumstances, the cells that form the wall of the gland should exfoliate from the pore opening. In certain circumstances these cells become dysfunctional and instead of exfoliating normally, block the pore opening. In the meantime, the glands keep producing sebum and if hormonal disturbance is present the glands produce sebum at a higher rate. This sebum keeps filling the gland sack and the bacteria called   Proprionobacterium acnes (P. acnes) thrive in the atmosphere that is full of sebum and no air. As the bacteria flourishes, the gland gets infected. At this stage when the bacteria are flourishing and causing inflammation, the gland is producing more sebum and the pore is blocked, the gland becomes very infective and full of dead cells, bacteria, pus and dead skin. This is what we call as a papule or a cyst. The acne grows through different stages and this is the last stage after which the gland ruptures. Thus acne is not a single stage disease but many causes join together to progressively increase the intensity of acne formation. Teenagers get more acne because the hormonal balance of their body changes during that period. The hormone androgen is normally responsible for accelerating the production of sebum. Doctors try to intervene during the process of formation of acne and its growth and try to prevent formation of cyst that may scar the skin forever. The same hormonal disturbance is responsible for acne outbreak in some women during their menstrual cycles. This article is only for informative purposes.

","keywords":" acne medications, acne treatments, side affects, Isotretinoin ","article_body":" Acne is an extremely common skin affliction affecting around 85% of teenagers and young adults as well as a significant proportion of adults. With a plethora of acne information available, it may also be difficult to establish what is the right treatment and/or medication.  In a previous article I suggested that as all of us are individuals, it is likely so to will the treatment for each person’s acne. Let’s delve a bit further into treatments and medication.  In the case of mild or even slightly worse acne, a good preventative and treatment regime if rigorously followed is often found to control the affliction. However there are obviously sufferers with severe acne where over the counter or non prescription treatments have not had the desired impact.  Whilst I would suggest in this instance finding a reputable dermatologist you will likely find that an acne treatment regime still has a place in assisting the overall treatment. It would be extremely advisable for those prescribed medications for the more severe acne affliction to carefully research the medication prior to commencing.  The clear example of this is the medication for “recalcitrant modular acne” being Isotretinoin (marketed as Accutane, Amnesteem, Claravis & Sotret).  The US Food and Drug Administration provides significant information in relation to this particular drug however in short it is known to cause birth defects and is being examined in relation to reports of suicide or suicidal thoughts associated with the use of the drug. A Risk Management program called iPLEDGE in relation to this drug is in place with information and updates available. The program is ensuring adequate controls are in place in relation to the use of this drug and the important message is “Do not purchase this drug over the internet”. There are a range of prescribed medications available with those applied to the skin for more mild to moderate cases and oral medications for more severe. Some of these include •\tOral antibiotics •\tOral contraceptives •\tAzelaic Acid •\tBenzoyl peroxide •\tClindamycin •\tErythromycin •\tSodium sulfacetamide •\tTazarotene •\tTretinoin •\tAdapalene The message is still however to do the appropriate research as information on some drugs may change significantly over time. Summary: Whilst medications are vital in the treatment of a significant number of conditions aside from acne, it is always wise to research the medication to allow a balanced approach or weighing up the benefits prior to commencing. This is obviously extremely clear in the case of the drug Isotretinoin for severe acne.

Before visiting a dermatologist for the first time, it is good to know what to expect especially in the type of acne medication that he or she is likely to prescribe. While seeking treatment, your dermatologist may prescribe you with more than one type of acne medication. This can be normal as acne is usually assessed on a-case-by-case basis. Therefore, acne medications that work for another does not necessarily imply that it will also work for you. Depending on the seriousness of your acne problem, your dermatologist may be prescribing you with a topical acne medication and/or a systematic approach to reduce the cases of flare-ups and inflammations. A topical acne medication treatment is one that is applied on the skin surface. It can come in different forms; for example, lotions, gels, soaps and creams. Benzoyl peroxide is a common ingredient in the majority of acne medications as it helps in slowing down the activities of the oil glands in producing skin oil called \"sebum\". However, continued use of this acne medication may cause the skin to dry and crack up plus a possible irritation and burning sensation may be felt. But this can be resolved pretty easily through minimizing the level of usage of benzoyl peroxide. It is important that this product is used over the infected area, not just directly to one or two individual pimples. Smearing and flaking are likely to carry the infection to other parts of the skin, like the back, shoulders and neck. So you have to be careful, when you apply this product. Retin A, a derivative of Vitamin A is not a topical acne medication but it is noted to show great effects on the growth of acne. It works by drying the skin thus preventing new pimples form developing. However, it is suggested that if you should use this, you must at all times, stay away from the sun as this may only aggravate the skin condition. Meanwhile, systematic acne medication is one that is taken internally to combat acne. It usually comes in the form of antibiotics. The type of antibiotic that you may use will depend largely on the severity of the case and your skin type. At times, you may be prescribed to use small amounts of antibiotic contents like that in Bacitracyn and many over the counter acne medications. On the average, these acne medications may take six to eight weeks before significant developments take effect. In certain cases, your dermatologist may prescribe you with hormonal acne medication reatment. The principle in most hormonal treatments is to control the release of hormones such as androgens and testosterone. This happens when the dermatologist decides that hormone imbalances is the cause of your acne. Of course, it is always best to get a professional and qualified skin specialist or dermatologist for a proper diagnosis. Choose one that comes highly recommended by your friends and relatives. Spend time to search for a good dermatologist.

","keywords":" acne, medicine, treatment, scar, scars, skin, care, medication, beauty, health ","article_body":" Patients with mild or occasional acne may be able to treat themselves without the use of prescription medication.  Such remedies may include an alteration in diet and exercise habits, regular cleansing to remove residue and buildup on the skin, choosing the right cosmetics and eliminating stress.  But for some individuals, this simply isn’t enough.  For those who suffer from moderate to severe acne, a stronger medication may be needed in order for that individual to find relief from their condition. There are several different types of medication that are commonly used to treat acne, each of which may contain the potential for certain side effects.  As is the case with most over-the-counter acne medication, prescription medicines are usually available as gels, creams, lotions or solutions.  In determining which is the best choice for the patient, a physician will study the skin type, severity of acne and the patient’s likelihood of having a negative reaction to any medication.  Once a prescription is written, the physician will explain how often to use the medicine and how to properly apply it to the skin. As mentioned previously, it is not uncommon for individuals to have a reaction to strong acne medication.  For some it is only temporary, but others may require a change in their prescription.  The most widely seen reaction is that of the skin’s condition actually worsening.  Many physicians agree that most medications will cause the skin to worsen before it actually improves, which may take 6-8 weeks of using a medication.  However, additional side effects may include extreme redness, burning, stinging, peeling, soreness, scaling or a discoloration of the skin.  If individuals notice these side effects becoming increasingly worse or if they do not go away after a specified period of use, which should be indicated by a physician, the medication may need to be changed. Individuals who take oral medications for the treatment of acne may face an entirely different set of potential side effects, including an upset stomach, dizziness and skin discoloration.  Certain types of medication can be dangerous to women who are pregnant or children under a certain age, so individuals should report any possible conditions to their physician prior to accepting a prescription. As with any medication, there are often risks and benefits of it’s use.  The best way to learn of these is to speak with a physician, ask about any potential side effects and completely disclose your current medical condition and any medications that you are currently taking.  In some instances, medications may negatively react with one another and this can be very dangerous to the patient.  Acne medicine is no different and the patient should have a complete understanding of how it operates before using it. The information in this article is intended for informational purposes only.  It should not be considered as, or used in place of, medical advice or professional recommendations for the cause, diagnosis or treatment of acne.

","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking with your prescriber (doctor or other health care provider). What is the most important information I should know about Accutane? Accutane is used to treat a type of severe acne (nodular acne) that has not been helped by other treatments, including antibiotics. However, Accutane can cause serious side effects. Before starting Accutane, discuss with your prescriber how bad your acne is, the possible benefits of Accutane, and its possible side effects, to decide if Accutane is right for you. Your prescriber will ask you to read and sign a form or forms indicating you understand some of the serious risks of Accutane. Possible serious side effects of taking Accutane include birth defects and mental disorders. 1. Birth defects. Accutane can cause birth defects (deformed babies) if taken by a pregnant woman. It can also cause miscarriage (losing the baby before birth), premature (early) birth, or death of the baby. Do not take Accutane if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant while you are taking Accutane. Do not get pregnant for 1 month after you stop taking Accutane. Also, if you get pregnant while taking Accutane, stop taking it right away and call your prescriber. All females should read the section in this Medication Guide \"What are the important warnings for females taking Accutane?\" 2. Mental problems and suicide. Some patients, while taking Accutane or soon after stopping Accutane, have become depressed or developed other serious mental problems. Symptoms of these problems include sad, \"anxious\" or empty mood, irritability, anger, loss of pleasure or interest in social or sports activities, sleeping too much or too little, changes in weight or appetite, school or work performance going down, or trouble concentrating. Some patients taking Accutane have had thoughts about hurting themselves or putting an end to their own lives (suicidal thoughts). Some people tried to end their own lives. And some people have ended their own lives. There were reports that some of these people did not appear depressed. No one knows if Accutane caused these behaviors or if they would have happened even if the person did not take Accutane. All patients should read the section in this Medication Guide \"What are the signs of mental problems?\" For other possible serious side effects of Accutane, see \"What are the possible side effects of Accutane?\" in this Medication Guide. What are the important warnings for females taking Accutane? You must not become pregnant while taking Accutane, or for 1 month after you stop taking Accutane. Accutane can cause severe birth defects in babies of women who take it while they are pregnant, even if they take Accutane for only a short time. There is an extremely high risk that your baby will be deformed or will die if you are pregnant while taking Accutane. Taking Accutane also increases the chance of miscarriage and premature births. Female patients will not get their first prescription for Accutane unless there is proof they have had 2 negative pregnancy tests. The first test must be done when your prescriber decides to prescribe Accutane. The second pregnancy test must be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period right before starting Accutane therapy, or as instructed by your prescriber. Each month of treatment, you must have a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test. Female patients cannot get another prescription for Accutane unless there is proof that they have had a negative pregnancy test. A yellow self-adhesive Accutane Qualification Sticker on your prescription indicates to the pharmacist that you are qualified by your prescriber to get Accutane. While you are taking Accutane, you must use effective birth control. You must use 2 separate effective forms of birth control at the same time for at least 1 month before starting Accutane, while you take it, and for 1 month after you stop taking it. You can either discuss effective birth control methods with your prescriber or go for a free visit to discuss birth control with another physician or family planning expert. Your prescriber can arrange this free visit, which will be paid for by the manufacturer. You must use 2 separate forms of effective birth control because any method, including birth control pills and sterilization, can fail. There are only 2 reasons you would not need to use 2 separate methods of effective birth control 1. You have had your womb removed by surgery (a hysterectomy). 2. You are absolutely certain you will not have genital-to-genital sexual contact with a male before, during, and for 1 month after Accutane treatment. If you have sex at any time without using 2 forms of effective birth control, get pregnant, or miss your period, stop using Accutane and call your prescriber right away. All patients should read the rest of this Medication Guide. What are the signs of mental problems? Tell your prescriber if, to the best of your knowledge, you or someone in your family has ever had any mental illness, including depression, suicidal behavior, or psychosis. Psychosis means a loss of contact with reality, such as hearing voices or seeing things that are not there. Also, tell your prescriber if you take medicines for any of these problems. Stop using Accutane and tell your provider right away if you ? Start to feel sad or have crying spells ? Lose interest in activities you once enjoyed ? Sleep too much or have trouble sleeping ? Become more irritable than usual ? Have a change in your appetite or body weight ? Have trouble concentrating ? Withdraw from your friends or family ? Feel like you have no energy ? Have feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt ? Start having thoughts about hurting yourself or taking your own life (suicidal thoughts) What is Accutane? Accutane is used to treat the most severe form of acne (nodular acne) that cannot be cleared up by any other acne treatments, including antibiotics. In severe nodular acne, many red, swollen, tender lumps form in the skin. These can be the size of pencil erasers or larger. If untreated, nodular acne can lead to permanent scars. However, because Accutane can have serious side effects, you should talk with your prescriber about all of the possible treatments for your acne, and whether Accutane?s possible benefits outweigh its possible risks. Who should not take Accutane? ? Do not take Accutane if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or become pregnant during Accutane treatment. Accutane causes severe birth defects. All females should read the section \"What are the important warnings for females taking Accutane?\" for more information and warnings about Accutane and pregnancy. ? Do not take Accutane unless you completely understand its possible risks and are willing to follow all of the instructions in this Medication Guide. Tell your prescriber if you or someone in your family has had any kind of mental problems, asthma, liver disease, diabetes, heart disease, osteoporosis (bone loss), weak bones, anorexia nervosa (an eating disorder where people eat too little), or any other important health problems. Tell your prescriber about any food or drug allergies you have had in the past. These problems do not necessarily mean you cannot take Accutane, but your prescriber needs this information to discuss if Accutane is right for you. How should I take Accutane? ? You will get no more than a 30-day supply of Accutane at a time, to be sure you check in with your prescriber each month to discuss side effects. ? Your prescription should have a special yellow self-adhesive sticker attached to it. The sticker is YELLOW. If your prescription does not have this yellow self-adhesive sticker, call your prescriber. The pharmacy should not fill your prescription unless it has the yellow self-adhesive sticker. ? The amount of Accutane you take has been specially chosen for you and may change during treatment. ? You will take Accutane 2 times a day with a meal, unless your prescriber tells you otherwise. Swallow your Accutane capsules with a full glass of liquid. This will help prevent the medication inside the capsule from irritating the lining of your esophagus (connection between mouth and stomach). For the same reason, do not chew or suck on the capsule. ? If you miss a dose, just skip that dose. Do not take 2 doses the next time. ? You should return to your prescriber as directed to make sure you don?t have signs of serious side effects. Because some of Accutane?s serious side effects show up in blood tests, some of these visits may involve blood tests (monthly visits for female patients should always include a urine or serum pregnancy test). What should I avoid while taking Accutane? ? Do not get pregnant while taking Accutane. See \"What is the most important information I should know about Accutane?\" and \"What are the important warnings for females taking Accutane?\" ? Do not breast feed while taking Accutane and for 1 month after stopping Accutane. We do not know if Accutane can pass through your milk and harm the baby. ? Do not give blood while you take Accutane and for 1 month after stopping Accutane. If someone who is pregnant gets your donated blood, her baby may be exposed to Accutane and may be born with birth defects. ? Do not take vitamin A supplements. Vitamin A in high doses has many of the same side effects as Accutane. Taking both together may increase your chance of getting side effects. ? Do not have cosmetic procedures to smooth your skin, including waxing, dermabrasion, or laser procedures, while you are using Accutane and for at least 6 months after you stop. Accutane can increase your chance of scarring from these procedures. Check with your prescriber for advice about when you can have cosmetic procedures. ? Avoid sunlight and ultraviolet lights as much as possible. Tanning machines use ultraviolet lights. Accutane may make your skin more sensitive to light. ? Do not use birth control pills that do not contain estrogen (\"minipills\"). They may not work while you take Accutane. Ask your prescriber or pharmacist if you are not sure what type you are using. ? Talk with your doctor if you plan to take other drugs or herbal products. This is especially important for patients using birth control pills and other hormonal types of birth control because the birth control may not work as effectively if you are taking certain drugs or herbal products. You should not take the herbal supplement St. John?s Wort because this herbal supplement may make birth control pills not work as effectively. ? Talk with your doctor if you are currently taking an oral or injected corticosteroid or anticonvulsant (seizure) medication prior to using Accutane. These drugs may weaken your bones. ? Do not share Accutane with other people. It can cause birth defects and other serious health problems. ? Do not take Accutane with antibiotics unless you talk to your prescriber. For some antibiotics, you may have to stop taking Accutane until the antibiotic treatment is finished. Use of both drugs together can increase the chances of getting increased pressure in the brain. What are the possible side effects of Accutane? Accutane has possible serious side effects ? Accutane can cause birth defects, premature births, and death in babies whose mothers took Accutane while they were pregnant.

This can lead to permanent loss of sight, or in rare cases, death. Stop taking Accutane and call your prescriber right away if you get any of these signs of increased brain pressure bad headache, blurred vision, dizziness, nausea, or vomiting. Also, some patients taking Accutane have had seizures (convulsions) or stroke. ? Abdomen (stomach area) problems. Certain symptoms may mean that your internal organs are being damaged. These organs include the liver, pancreas, bowel (intestines), and esophagus (connection between mouth and stomach). If your organs are damaged, they may not get better even after you stop taking Accutane. Stop taking Accutane and call your prescriber if you get severe stomach, chest or bowel pain, trouble swallowing or painful swallowing, new or worsening heartburn, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, yellowing of your skin or eyes, or dark urine. ? Bone and muscle problems. Accutane may affect bones, muscles, and ligaments and cause pain in your joints or muscles. Tell your prescriber if you plan vigorous physical activity during treatment with Accutane. Tell your prescriber if you develop pain, particularly back pain or joint pain. There are reports that some patients have had stunted growth after taking Accutane for acne as directed. There are also some reports of broken bones or reduced healing of broken bones after taking Accutane for acne as directed. No one knows if taking Accutane for acne will affect your bones. If you have a broken bone, tell your provider that you are taking Accutane. Muscle weakness with or without pain can be a sign of serious muscle damage. If this happens, stop taking Accutane and call your prescriber right away. ? Hearing problems. Some people taking Accutane have developed hearing problems. It is possible that hearing loss can be permanent. Stop using Accutane and call your prescriber if your hearing gets worse or if you have ringing in your ears. ? Vision problems. While taking Accutane you may develop a sudden inability to see in the dark, so driving at night can be dangerous. This condition usually clears up after you stop taking Accutane, but it may be permanent. Other serious eye effects can occur. Stop taking Accutane and call your prescriber right away if you have any problems with your vision or dryness of the eyes that is painful or constant. ? Lipid (fats and cholesterol in blood) problems. Many people taking Accutane develop high levels of cholesterol and other fats in their blood. This can be a serious problem. Return to your prescriber for blood tests to check your lipids and to get any needed treatment. These problems generally go away when Accutane treatment is finished. ? Allergic reactions. In some people, Accutane can cause serious allergic reactions. Stop taking Accutane and get emergency care right away if you develop hives, a swollen face or mouth, or have trouble breathing. Stop taking Accutane and call your prescriber if you develop a fever, rash, or red patches or bruises on your legs. ? Signs of other possibly serious problems. Accutane may cause other problems. Tell your prescriber if you have trouble breathing (shortness of breath), are fainting, are very thirsty or urinate a lot, feel weak, have leg swelling, convulsions, slurred speech, problems moving, or any other serious or unusual problems.

Read on and you will discover the truth about 9 of the most common acne myths and be armed with information to do something about your acne. ","keywords":" acne myths, acne, acne treatment, acne medication, cures, remedies, scars, laser, vulgaris, rosacea ","article_body":" It's unbelievable ... What if I told you that most of the popular beliefs about acne, are in fact myths? Let’s take a look at some popular beliefs about acne to dispel any other rumors ... Myth #1 Is it true that increased stress spreads acne? Not exactly. What is true is that ultimately stress can have a very minimal or minor influence all by itself. It cannot actually cause acne, but it can influence reoccurrences of acne as stress increases the body’s creation of a substance called cortisol that in turn causes your sebaceous glands to produce increased amounts of sebum oil that can be blocked in pores. Note, however, that some medications people take when trying to deal with or treat stress can have a large influence on acne as the result of medication side effects. Myth #2 Acne is contagious, true or false? Not! No one can \"catch\" acne; it is non-communicable. Myth #3You’ll outgrow acne, so just leave it alone - myth or truth? This is false. Acne strikes all ages and is treatable, but shouldn’t be left alone to possibly worsen. Myth #4 Being out in the sun helps acne, right? In the long run, no. The sun may appear to help clear up your blemishes and redden your skin, thus lessening the overall reddish effect of the targeted acne area when it was outstanding. However, rays from the sun can cause skin damage and actually irritate skin more, worsening any existing acne problems in the process and clogging more pores as skin cells dry up and slough off quicker than normal. So use caution (and sunscreen) here! Myth #5 Sweating helps clean out your hair follicle areas, myth or reality? Another myth. In reality, strenuous activity can temporarily increase your body’s oil production that can actually worsen acne problem areas, causing recurrence or intensification. Myth #6 Acne problems are directly proportionate to sexual activity, or lack thereof; true or false? False, another myth. Just because teenagers are going through hormonal changes, does not mean that this has anything to do with acne. Both are separate issues. Same with adult acne and sex; two entirely different issues. Myth #7 People with acne are dirty and don’t wash enough. Not! This is another myth. Acne is the result of a build up of oil, dead skin cells and bacteria in a closed pore. Period. Dirt is not even a factor in the equation. Myth #8 Acne is only on external issue or surface deep; i.e. people shouldn’t make such a big thing out of it, myth or reality? Myth. In reality, yes, it basically is only on your skin (and underneath the surface a little bit). However, the effects run much more deeper than that in many instances. More than 50 percent of those suffering acne problems reported negative comments and other feedback from members of society, regardless of whether or not there was any scarring left for others to see afterwards. And resulting internal depression and low self-esteem can be harmful emotionally not only short-term but over a person’s lifetime.  So acne can indeed be a very big issue requiring healthcare treatment and support. Myth #9 OK, myth or reality there is a cure for acne? Myth. Although there is no cure at this time, there are many treatments available that do a great job. As the saying goes, \"Prevention is the best medicine;\" however, there is no need to suffer in silence with all the options available on the market today for all price ranges.

Thankfully, scientific research has dispelled  a lot of these 'acne myths'.  We now have a pretty good idea of what does and does not cause acne.  Let's take a look at seven of the biggest of these acne myths. True or False? Find out the truth about common acne and its myths Acne Myth #1  Acne is caused by eating certain foods This one has been around a long time yet is supported by exactly no scientific proof.  Although certain individuals may seem experience outbreaks when they eat certain foods, there is no universal laws that apply to everyone.  Eating pizza, chocolate, nuts, and greasy foods will not increase your acne. Acne Myth #2  Acne is related to dirt or having dirty skin Although having clean skin has other benefits, dirt does not cause acne.  Acne is formed under the surface of the skin and is due to build-ups of sebum and dead skin cells.  It's not dirt that clogs your follicles. Acne Myth #3  Washing your face all the time will clear up acne This kind of relates to myth #3.  Having clean skin is not the answer to preventing acne.  Overdoing it as far as washing your face can actually make matters worse.  Stripping your skin of oil could lead to future breakouts. Acne Myth #4  Only teenagers get acne It is true that 9 out of 10 teenagers experience acne, but it is also true that about 1 in 4 adults get it also.  Acne seems to be connected with hormones which would explain why teenagers have such a high incidence of acne, but adults are also going through hormonal changes at various times in their lives. Acne Myth #5  Stress causes acne Scientific evidence shows that stress is not that large of a factor in acne.  It was believed for many years that stress caused bouts of acne but it simply isn't so. Acne Myth # 6  Acne can be cured Many people view acne as a disease that can be permanently cured.  Unfortunately, this isn't the case.  Acne can be controlled and prevented through proper skin care, but it cannot be cured.

","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" New Laser Therapy Prevents Acne From Graduating to Scars What’s a four letter word for a skin condition that affects nearly 80 percent of the population in various forms and can cause considerable emotional stress?  If you answered acne, then you hit this hard-to-treat condition on the head.  While a more difficult question might have been how to treat acne, dermatologists are at the forefront of using laser technology to stop acne in its tracks – and prevent the acne scars that are often a result. No. 1 Skin Condition Acne is the most commonly diagnosed skin disorder in the world, topping the list of reasons that patients seek out the help of a dermatologist.  While studies show that acne is not caused by diet or stress but by physiological factors such as hormones, excess oil and bacteria, patients often place the blame on their own shoulders. “Acne patients are often times truly frustrated, and rightfully so,” said by a dermatologist.  “They hear mixed messages about the causes of acne and sometimes spend an enormous amount of time and money trying to treat the condition with the latest over-the-counter products.  By the time I see them in my office, the acne usually has worsened to the point that it is affecting their self-esteem and social lives.  But it’s important to remember that acne is a treatable medical condition.” Acne lesions are prevalent on parts of the body where there is a high concentration of pores that contain oil-producing sebaceous follicles, such as the face, neck, chest, shoulders, and upper back.  When these follicles become clogged and inflamed, blackheads and whiteheads develop.  If a whitehead or blackhead ruptures, its infected contents come into contact with the skin and the infection spreads - producing what is classically referred to as a zit.  In a worst-case scenario, the zit becomes so badly infected it turns into a cyst that is located deep in the skin.  If left untreated, these painful lesions can lead to an acne scar. Until recently, a combination of topical and oral medications - including antibiotics - has been used almost exclusively with varying degrees of success to combat acne.  Now, dermatologists are using non-ablative laser technology to successfully treat active acne and the scarring that often results as well. One of the main benefits of non-ablative lasers, in contrast to their ablative counterparts, is that they can clear acne without producing a notable injury to the outer layer of the skin.  Non-ablative therapy works by targeting the overactive sebaceous glands that are responsible for acne.  The laser emits a wavelength of light that is strongly absorbed by water within the skin.  This generates heat in and around the sebaceous glands.  By creating a mild thermal injury just below the skin’s surface, a non-ablative laser alters the structure and function of the sebaceous gland, leading to prolonged acne clearance. \"I believe that laser-based applications for acne will one day become the preferred treatment option for acne patients, many of which are dissatisfied with topical and systemic treatments and are wary of their risks and side effects,\" explained by the dermatologist. \"I use non-ablative therapy extensively in my practice, and I've found it to be a safe and cost-effective treatment that has dramatically changed my patients' lives for the better.\" Non-ablative treatments typically take between five to 20 minutes, during which time the patient experiences a slight snapping or stinging sensation that is alleviated with a pre-treatment topical anesthetic and post-treatment ice application.  A series of three to five treatments are delivered at monthly intervals in order to achieve the desired clearance. Marked reduction in acne lesions often occurs within a couple of treatment sessions, and a series of treatments should result in acne clearance for more than six months.  Side effects are limited to mild redness and swelling, which will not interfere with a person’s daily activities. Acne’s Cruel Reminders Non-ablative laser therapy is also being used to successfully treat the scars that remain long after the initial acne has been cleared.  While acne scars rarely pose a health risk, they are difficult to treat and can be very damaging to a person’s self-esteem. Traditionally, dermatologists have used dermabrasion, surgical excision, and fillers, such as collagen, to diminish scarring.  However, the results in many cases were limited. Over the last several years, laser technology has assumed an increasingly important role in the treatment of acne scars.  At first, ablative lasers were used to sculpt or vaporize the skin's surface.  Now, techniques involving non-ablative lasers have taken over, thanks primarily to their ability to promote collagen growth beneath an acne scar without creating an external injury. \"Our experience has shown that patients treated with this therapy experience significant improvement in the appearance of their acne scars,” said by a dermatologist.  “After a series of three monthly non-ablative treatments, patients have many times exceeded our expectations and often outperformed the results obtained by ablative lasers.\" With medical technology advancing at a rapid rate, Dr. Alster cautioned patients to be sure to consult a dermatologist experienced in laser therapy for proper treatment. \"Don’t be afraid to ask your physician questions about his or her experience and qualifications or training with a particular procedure,” said Dr. Alster.  “Since any type of laser procedure can carry potential side effects, it’s important to entrust your care to qualified hands.\" Kerwin Chang writes for <a href=\"http//www.acnestuff.net\">http//www.acnestuff.net</a> where you can find out more about <a href=\"http//www.acnestuff.net\">acne and other skin</a> care topics.

With nearly 17 million people suffering from the disorder, in the United States alone, it is easily one of the most common skin diseases. A disorder that results when hormones react to your skin’s sebaceous glands, acne is a severely embarrassing and potentially disfiguring disorder that can cause deep scarring and emotional distress. Naturally, a slew of new treatment options are available, including over the counter (OTC), prescription drugs and more to help combat this skin disorder. Even for very severe cases, treatments are available to help. The over the counter topical remedies (lotions, creams, gels) are not prescribed by a doctor and can be purchased at any drugstore and have been shown to be very effective.  The main ingredients in these products are often benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, or sulfur, which do help in clearing up acne most of the time. Several types of prescription topical medicines include benzoyl peroxide, tretinoin, adapalene, and azelaic acid. These can work well also, however some people develop side effects including stinging, burning, redness, peeling, scaling, or discoloration of the skin. Then there are non-prescription products like Acuzine that come in pill form and contain Co-Enzyme Q-10, vitamin E,  Alpha Lipoic Acid, Aloe Vera and other natural antioxidant ingredients.  They work at the problem from the inside out, similar to antibiotics and usually have a minimum of side effects. One common prescription medication is called Accutane.  Many people have seen excellent results with this product, however there are side effects for some people.  These include upset stomach, dizziness or lightheadedness, changes in skin color, and dry skin. No matter what treatment you choose for your skin condition, do not expect immediate results. Most products take at least four to six weeks before you notice a significant improvement. Some take more, others may take slightly less but four to six weeks is the average wait. However, the earlier it’s treated the less chance you have of scarring and that’s got to be worth something. Whether you have mild or severe acne, there is a product that is right for you. Consult with your doctor, conduct your own research and in no time you will have found a perfect treatment regimen for your skin type. Soon enough, you’ll be on your way to clear skin.

This is how- Acne- what are the main reasons of formation? The main reasons of acne formation are- blocked pore, excess production of sebum, infection in the sebum and the gland.  Suppose we don't care about controlling sebum production. After all there is not much that we can do about that because it is hormonal.  We focus our attention on the blocked glands. Let us remove the blocks daily. If we can do that, the excess sebum will always go out on the skin and never get infected. Our target should be- keep the pores open. What blocks the pores? The pores are blocked by the dead skin cells, that should normally get shed naturally but accumulate on the mouth of the gland and block it. Acne- How to remove dead cells daily? How do we remove the dead cells daily? Use of a substance that peels the skin layers from the top is best suited for this. Use of materials that dissolve the binding cement of dead cells is also needed. Peel off the top layer of dead cells.

Acne can even spread to different parts of the body, including your neck, your back, and your chest, and can be a very embarrassing skin condition. Those who have severe acne should most certainly seek the advice of a dermatologist for possible treatment options. For those who do not have acne, most of the time, you can prevent it from ever occurring. The following paragraphs will take a look at a few ways to prevent this skin condition. Diet Most people do not realize it, but our skin is the largest organ that expels waste from our bodies, in conjunction with our intestines, bladders, and colons. Because of this, how we eat will be reflected in by the condition of our skin. By eliminating unhealthy foods from our diets, we are decreasing the amount of toxin being expelled from our pores. Thus, we can help prevent an acne outbreak from development by eating a healthier diet. Nutrients recommended to add to your diet to help with acne prevention include • zinc • vitamin A • vitamin E • vitamin B6 Each of these vitamins and minerals can aid in the prevention of acne in their own way. While zinc, especially in the form of zinc gluconate or zinc sulfate, can reduce the androgenic hormonal effects on our skin. Vitamin A can help reduce sebum production. Vitamin E helps protect skin cell membrane from damage, as well as helps maintain healthy skin my eliminating harmful free radicals from our bodies, that can often be generated during physical activities. Vitamin B6 helps prevent premenstrual acne, and reduce the sensitivity to the effects of testosterone. By adding foods rich in these vitamins and nutrients to your diet, you can reduce your chances of getting acne. Exercise Getting regular exercise can also help prevent acne. When we exercise, we are increasing the blood flow to our skin, and providing more oxygen to our skin cells. Sweating moderately also cleans our skin pores from the inside out, also aiding in the prevention of acne. Regular exercise and moderate sweating are excellent ways of helping to prevent acne, but taking a shower immediately afterwards is very important. Detoxification Detoxification is the process of removing harmful toxins from our bodies. Many different types of cleansers are available to help prevent acne, including • colon cleanses • liver flushes • enemas When there is a toxin build up in vital parts of our digestive system, the toxins begin to excrete themselves from our skin pores, increasing the chances of an acne outbreak. By eliminating the build up of toxins, we are helping to prevent acne. "},{"title":" Acne Prevention - Do and Dont's ","word_count":555,"summary":" Things to remember to prevent the worsen of acne. ","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs, pimples, PIMPLES ","article_body":" As stated in the previous pages, pimples are not the result of poor hygiene nor are they caused by foods. Having said this, you can aggravate your pimples and worsen your condition. So pay close attention to the information on this page so as to not deteriorate your condition further. Do's • Use skincare products that will not 'clog pores', they are usually described as 'oil-free' and/or 'non-comedogenic' on the package. • Skin care should include a mild cleanser and application of a non-comedogenic sunscreen on sun-exposed surfaces. • Gently wash your face twice a day using mild face cleanser and pat dry. • When you are washing your face, be sure you take the time to remove all of your makeup. • Be patient! Treatment may take a few weeks to start having useful effects. • Remember that all of the treatments only work by preventing new spots and that all treatments have to be tried for at least four months before you decide whether they are helping. • Some acne products can increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight and ultraviolet light from tanning booths so use protective clothing and sunscreens and avoid tanning booths. • If irritation, dryness and peeling occur, an oil-free, non-comedogenic moisturizer can be used. • If your skin is getting too irritated, red or dry while undergoing a topical treatment, then start using them every other day. It takes time for your skin to adapt to your new medicines. • If you have long hair that touches your face, be sure to wash it frequently enough to keep oil away. Also wash your face after you've been exercising hard and sweating a lot. And try not to touch your face throughout the day. Dont's • Avoid thick, greasy make-up over affected areas. Some make-up is acceptable but try to choose \"non-comedogenic\" cosmetics if possible. • Resist the temptation to squeeze your acne. This can cause the area to spread and become more inflamed and therefore more likely to scar. • Do not use harsh soaps when washing face. Vigorously washing and scrubbing will irritate your skin and only make your acne worse. • Avoid things that may aggravate your acne such as oils, airborne grease, irritating clothing etc… • Avoid covering yourself with thick layers of make up, and if you do, wash it off as soon as you can, certainly do not leave on overnight. • Avoid strongly fragranced or alcohol based products. • Avoid from hair sprays or gels, try to keep them away from your face, as they can also clog up pores. • Acne isn't really helped by the sun, either. Although a suntan can temporarily make acne look less severe, it won't help it go away permanently. So don't soak up those rays - either under the sun or from a tanning bed - in an effort to help your skin. • Avoid wearing hats or headbands that rub on your forehead, since this can also make acne worse. • Avoid touching your face a lot, as your hands have oil on them and this can make acne worse. IMPORTANT Individual pimples can take up to 2 or 3 months to form even though they may appear to \"pop-up\" overnight. Thus, although there is often some initial improvement in the first few weeks after starting a new treatment, it takes at least 2-3 months of regular use before you can assess the full benefit of any acne treatment. "},{"title":" Acne Prevention - Hygiene and Medication ","word_count":916,"summary":" Thru the process of proper hygiene and medication, acne can be prevented from growing. ","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" Proper Hygiene One of the most common misconceptions about acne is that it's caused by dirt. It's not! Acne is caused by a combination of factors you can't control, like your hormone balance and the natural pace of your skin's renewal system. Fortunately, there are a number of things you can control that may help you keep your acne in check. Begin by following these simple suggestions for healthy-skin hygiene. Acne Prevention - Tip #1 Don't over-wash. Since dirt is not causing your acne, excessive scrubbing and washing won't make it go away. Try to limit yourself to two washings per day — anything more than that can leave your healthy skin dry, and your acne-prone areas irritated. Habitual over-washing may also stimulate extra oil production, which could result in more breakouts. Acne Prevention - Tip #2 Skip harsh scrubs. It's okay to exfoliate, but be sure to use a gentle formula with small, smooth grains. Avoid products with almond or apricot shell fragments; they can irritate or even tear your skin and further aggravate your acne. Acne Prevention - Tip #3 Say no to alcohol. If you use a toner, avoid products with high concentrations of isopropyl alcohol, or common rubbing alcohol. A strong astringent, alcohol strips the top layer of your skin, causing your sebaceous glands to produce more oil. The result? Dry, red skin — and possibly more blemishes. Acne Prevention - Tip #4 Don't squeeze or pick. Squeezing or picking your blemishes — with fingernails, pins or anything else — can force bacteria deeper into the skin, causing greater inflammation and infection. You'll also increase the damage to the surrounding skin, so the blemish is more likely to leave a permanent acne scar. Acne Prevention - Tip #5 Hands off! Propionibacterium acnes (the bacteria that causes breakouts) is a normal resident of your skin; it doesn't lead to acne until it gets trapped inside the hair follicle. Excessive touching of your face, including rubbing or even resting your chin in your hands, can drive bacteria into your pores — where it can begin its dirtywork. Acne Prevention - Tip #6 Work out, wash off. When you exercise, your movement generates heat; clothing and equipment cause friction. Until you shower off, heat and moisture are trapped against your skin, creating an ideal breeding ground for the spread of bacteria. So whenever you can, shower off immediately after exercising. Acne Medications Acne Prevention Treatment - Find a regimen and stick with it. Most cases of mild acne can be improved with \"over-the-counter\" products, or products that don't require a prescription from your doctor. There is a wide range of treatments available, and there’s a good chance one of them will work for you. If you start treatment before your acne gets severe, you’ll have a better chance of avoiding physical and emotional problems down the road. But if your acne gets worse or lasts more than a couple of weeks, see a dermatologist. Here's a quick listing of the most common products used to treat acne — click on the links that interest you for more information on that course of acne treatment. • Benzoyl Peroxide Kills the bacteria that causes acne. • Proactiv® Solution A dermatologist formulated Combination Therapy® acne management system. Click Here and receive 2 free bonuses when you try Proactiv® Solution Risk-Free for 60 Days! • Salicylic Acid Unclogs your pores and encourages skin renewal. • Tretinoin (Retin-A®) Promotes healthy sloughing. • Antibiotics Kill bacteria and reduces inflammation. • Oral Contraceptives Help regulate hormone levels. • Anti-Androgens Inhibit the body's production of acne-causing hormones. • Isotretinoin (Accutane®) Treatment for severe cystic or nodular acne. There are a number of prescription medications known to cause acne. If you routinely take any of the following drugs (or drugs like them) and have problems with acne breakouts, you may want to consult your physician to discuss an alternative treatment with fewer side affects. But try to keep it in perspective, your health comes first! Anticonvulsants (like Dilantin) are prescribed for the treatment of epilepsy and other kinds of seizures. Most medications in this family list acne as a common side-effect. Corticosteroids (like Prednisone) are often used to treat asthma and other chronic lung diseases. Like cortisol, a natural steroid produced by the body during times of intense stress, corticosteroids can stimulate sebum production and lead to blemishes. Disulfuram (or Antabuse) is prescribed to help chronic alcoholic patients who want to remain in a state of enforced sobriety. When mixed with alcohol, this drug causes a range of unpleasant symptoms intended to discourage further mixing. Unfortunately, regular use of Disulfuram (even when not drinking) can cause acne in some patients. Immuran. Like other immunosuppressants, Immuran is used to suppress the immune system in patients awaiting an organ transplant. It can help prevent organ rejection; it can also suppress your body’s natural ability to fight the bacteria that cause acne. INH (or Isoniazid) is typically used to treat tuberculosis, or TB. Thought to be largely eradicated, TB experienced a resurgence in the late 1980s among the homeless population and in patients suffering from AIDS. It continues to be a problem today. Quinine is prescribed as a precaution against — or treatment for — malaria. If you’re traveling to a part of the world where malaria is a risk, be sure to ask your doctor about alternative solutions. Thyroid preparations. Some thyroid medications (such as Thiourea and Thiouracil) are known to trigger acne. These preparations are used to stimulate the thyroid gland in patients with low thyroid function. Large amounts of iodine, which also helps to regulate thyroid function, can also cause breakouts. "},{"title":" Acne Prevention - Lifestyle and Diets ","word_count":1212,"summary":" A healthy lifestyle and proper diet help prevent the growth of acne. ","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" Lifestyle Is your lifestyle causing your acne? Certainly not. But the way you live affects your whole body, including its largest organ the skin. The place you work, the hours you keep, the ways you play — all of these can take a toll on the epidermis, especially in those who are prone to acne. Following are a few everyday acne triggers you might not be aware of, and a few things you can do to avoid them. Comedones on the job. Since some part of your skin is always in contact with your environment, it’s important to pay attention to the substances with which you come into contact on a regular basis. You may be exposing yourself to comedogenic (pore-clogging) substances on the job without even knowing it; while these substances are not the cause of your acne, they can aggravate it. For example the airborne grease in a fast-food restaurant can create an invisible film on your skin, clogging your pores. Most industrial oils — the kinds used in cars, in factories, on bicycles — are comedogenic as well. Acne & Sleep - Sleep and your skin. The simplest good deed you can do for your skin may surprise you sleep! Scientists and mothers around the world agree that a good night’s sleep — at least eight hours — can do wonders for your complexion. How? A healthy, well-rested body has the resources to build a strong immune system. While a robust immune system won’t prevent acne altogether, it can help fight infection so your lesions clear up more quickly. Luckily, your body isn’t picky; uninterrupted sleep in the daytime is just as beneficial. So if you work late, sleep late — and try to maintain a regular schedule. Acne & Sun - Savvy sun worshipping. While it’s true that small amounts of sun exposure may initially improve acne, don’t be fooled; the benefit is temporary. Consistent sun bathing will dry your skin, causing your sebaceous glands to produce more oil. Also, skin that has been exposed to the sun has to slough old cells more frequently; when you combine the extra oil and extra dead cells, you create the ideal environment for comedones, or blocked pores. So if you work (or play) in the sun, it’s important to protect your skin with sunscreen. Look for oil-free products that provide at least an SPF 15 protection level from UVA and UVB rays. Acne & Stress - The stress connection. Not surprisingly, stress often has a starring role in the ongoing acne drama. “Ninety percent of my patients complain about what stress does to their skin. It has a huge impact, and it’s becoming a bigger problem every day,” says Katie Rodan, MD, a clinical professor of dermatology at Stanford University. How can stress — emotional anxiety caused by any number of factors in your life — show up on your face? The connection is purely chemical. When you become tense, your adrenal glands go work, flooding your bloodstream with the hormone cortisol. This triggers the sweat glands in your face to produce more oil. When your sebaceous glands go into high gear, there’s a higher probability that this excess oil will mix with dead skin cells and clog your pores, trapping bacteria inside. The result? More acne, primarily inflamed papules rather than blackheads or whiteheads. What can you do? Of course, you can't eliminate stress from your life — it's part of being human. But you can minimize its damage by leading a healthy lifestyle. A balanced diet and at least seven hours of sleep every night will help you build a stronger physical foundation; if you're well fed and well rested, you're less likely to feel irritated by the events of your day. Try to get some exercise every day, even if it's just a walk around the block at lunchtime. It's also important to take time out of every day to relax — read a book, take a bath, practice yoga, or do whatever makes you feel happy and calm. It's an important step towards overall good health, and therefore the health of your skin. Diets Don’t eat that — you’ll get zits! We’ve all heard it; from parents, friends or even the family doctor. But the fact is, even after extensive study, scientists have not found a connection between diet and acne. Not chocolate. Not french fries. Not pizza. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, “A healthy diet is important for improving raw materials for healthy skin,” but they also note that greasy or sugary foods do not cause acne.1 Likewise, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association concurred, “Diet plays no role in acne treatment in most patients…even large amounts of certain foods have not clinically exacerbated acne.”1 Of course, that doesn’t mean you should make a habit of eating foods high in sugar or fat. The skin is the body’s largest organ, so what’s good for the rest of you will be good for your skin, too. Acne Prevention & Diet - Nutrients for healthy skin. There are a number of nutrients found in everyday foods that are known to promote a healthy body — and therefore healthy skin. Get wise to these substances, and you’ll increase your chances of conquering your acne. Acne Prevention & Diet - Vitamin A. Naturally occurring Vitamin A, or retinol, is found in fish oils, liver and dairy products. The Vitamin A produced by plants is known as Beta-carotene, and is found in yellow/orange fruits and vegetable such as carrots, yams, apricots and cantaloupe, as well as green vegetables like parsley, kale and spinach. Extremely high doses of Vitamin A are toxic, so don't overdo it. Acne Prevention & Diet - Vitamin B-2. Stress has been known to aggravate existing cases of acne, and Vitamin B-2 is often helpful alleviating stress. Foods with a high concentration of B-2 include whole grains, fish, milk, eggs, meat and leafy green vegetables. Acne Prevention & Diet - Vitamin B-3. Found in peanuts, eggs, avocados, liver and lean meats, Vitamin B-3 improves circulation, promoting healthy skin. It also reduces the cholesterol level in the blood and helps you metabolize protein, sugar & fat — increasing your energy through proper utilization of food. Acne Prevention & Diet - Vitamin E. Vitamin E is found in almonds, peanuts, sunflower seeds, broccoli, wheat germ and vegetable oils. A powerful antioxidant, it protects your cells against the effects of free radicals, which are potentially damaging by-products of the body’s metabolism. Acne Prevention & Diet - Zinc. Even in trace amounts, the antioxidant zinc is known to boost the immune system, improving overall health — which of course is reflected in the skin. Zinc can be found in eggs, whole grains, nuts and mushrooms. Acne Prevention & Diet - Know your own triggers. Since acne is different for everyone, there may be certain foods that cause flare-ups in your skin. Clearly, these foods should be avoided. You may also want to check your vitamin supplements for their iodine content; while normal amounts of iodine have not been shown to affect skin, amounts greater than the RDA of 150 mcg may aggravate your acne. Overall, use your common sense. Drink lots of water and eat a healthy, balanced diet — but don’t be afraid to indulge your cravings every now and then.

The article also details some of the important considerations one should take before getting dermatological treatment. ","keywords":" skin infection, inflammation ","article_body":" Acne is a skin infection that may be considered as one of the worst things that can happen to a person, especially during the teenage years. Aside from the obvious physical damage it can do, one would also have to contend with things such as the social impact and the psychological damage that it could bring. A person may even have to deal with scarring and inflammation even after the acne is gone. As with most other medical ailments, it is always a good idea to test first on what medications are available in the market. Depending on how sensitive a person's skin is, one would want to try benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid as possible treatments for this specific skin infection. One might also consider using both, but at different times in a day. If no improvement is visible after a certain period (typically from six to eight weeks should be enough), then this would be the time that one might want to consider seeking professional help. A dermatologist would definitely know more about this type of skin infection and how one might handle this problem, not to mention knowing what specific treatments one might need to use if an over-the-counter product just isn't doing the job. One might want to know that prescription treatments are generally more potent and more expensive than the usual medications. There are a few things to consider when a visit to the dermatologist is needed l\tif over the counter treatments do not have any positive effect on the acne problem; l\tif a person has more than one sign of skin infection, such as whiteheads, blackheads, or red spots; l\tif the acne appears not just in the face, but also throughout the body; l\tif scars are visible on areas where one previously had acne; l\tif there is pus filled spots on one's face that is painful when touched or tampered with; l\tif there is continuous inflammation in the face; and l\tif this skin infection starts to limit one's social interactions. A person with acne should keep these points in mind whenever he decides to seek help from a  dermatologist. Communication with one's dermatologist is important so that a person undergoing treatment can fully discuss the nature of the problem and the ways to continue the treatment at home.  Discussions with the dermatologist should be as thorough and accurate as possible. It may be quite embarrassing for some but the consequences of skin infection can be so serious that no one should neglect getting all the information about acne treatment. In addition, one may need to bring a history of their previous acne records so that the doctor or dermatologist can prepare allergy-free treatments and other anti-acne products. Treatment of acne is not only a medical issue but a matter of great importance to one's self-esteem and personal hygiene.  Acne is not only unsightly but also causes embarrassment and a certain degree of social anxiety.  But a person with acne need not despair since a lot of treatment options are now available to heal those unsightly inflammations and scars.

This article contains basic tips and strategies that, if followed, will get quick results! ","keywords":" Acne, Acne Treatment, Acne Prevention, Acne Problem, Control Acne, Prevent Acne, Acne Medication ","article_body":" Copyright 2006 Tony Buel Is it possible to take some basic preventive measures to thwart acne outbreaks?  What kinds of preventative maintenance should you do to cut down on your acne? Let's quickly scan some of the most effective strategies, shall we? The first, most obvious, and most important measure to help prevent acne is to have a healthy lifestyle. It is too easy to neglect this, but don't do it!  Eat three good meals a day, get the proper rest at night, and drink a minimum of eight glasses of water a day.  Don't let stress control you even if you do have a frantic and unpredictable lifestyle. Now that the first one is out of the way, let's move on to the rest. Make sure you are cleaning your face every day and for best results, twice a day. Use a mild cleaning bar or liquid that also minimizes sensitivity and irritation. Use various mild scrubs or exfoliants that remove the outer layer of the skin and opens pores. The products that contain fine granules or salicylic acid make it a mild peeling agent. Reducing oil is an important step in preventing outbreaks of acne. You can't stop your oil glands from forming oil but you can get rid of the excess oil on your skin. This will help in keeping the pores open and lessen the shine that often accompanies oily skin. A gentle astringent can wipe away excess oil and are easily found where cosmetics are sold. Pharmacies now carry strips under various names that you can use on your forehead, nose or chin, or wherever you notice blackheads to pull out all that unpleasant material from your pores. Remember, this is oil and not dirt. They are inexpensive and while they aren't as effective as a professional pore cleaning, they are safe and effective. Killing bacteria is an important part of the therapy to minimize or prevent outbreaks of acne. Antibacterial cleansers can be found in over-the-counter products. They usually contain benzoyl peroxide. Topical or external applications can be applied to the affected area to kill surface bacteria. You can find these in the form of gels, creams, and lotions. When using moisturizers, use oil-free moisturizers that also contain an antibacterial agent. If you use make up, use oil-free foundation. A thick coat of make up can block the pores and cause acne to flare up. Apply a honey mask once or twice a week. Honey is great for disinfecting and healing minor blemishes and takes it easy on sensitive skin. Avoid wearing excessive make up.  Also, be sure it is water based. Drink eight full glasses of water per day. Keep your hair off your face. Take a good multivitamin. Take a chromium supplement once a day. Eat carrots; they are rich in beta-carotene and Vitamin A. Both are essential in repair tissue of the skin and mucous membranes. When you sleep at night, be sure you are sleeping on a clean pillowslip that no one else has used. Pillowslips absorb oil during the night and acne can be irritated. If you have long hair, keep it pulled back during the night as the oil in your hair can also transfer to your pillowslip and to your skin. Don't pick or squeeze your pimples -no matter how tempting! This can't be said too often. These are just a few simple measures you can start to follow right away.  Don't look for extreme remedies when a simple solution is all you need.  For many acne cases, when following these simple strategies you will begin to see gradual steady results in just a few days.

The blackheads category is more for prevention than curing an outbreak of pimples. This is the category you should use most because, the most important factor in acne control is early prevention. The second category, acne cures is used if an outbreak has already occurred. Before starting any of these treatments, you must first be sure that you are not allergic to any of the ingredients that are used. All of these treatments are intended to be used along with your normal skin cleansing. You should wash your face twice daily with a mild soap and water. When wshing your face you should be gentle, as harsh scrubbing can cause severe outbreaks of acne. Blackheads Mix lime juice and milk in a 1 to 1 ratio. The milk should be allowed to come to room temperature before mixing. Once mixed this is used as a cleanser in problem areas, where the skin may be oily. Use every other day under normal circumstances. Mix neem leaves and tumeric powder into a very thin paste this can be used to gently wash the face. Use every other day. Boil 2 teaspoons of Funigreek in a gallon of water, allow to cool to room temperature. This can be used every other day as a facial wash. Acne cures Make salt and vinegar paste. Apply directly to pimples wait 30 minutes and wash face. This can be done nightly if needed.

If you want to know how to get rid of pimples, and deal with other skin problems like oiliness and blackheads, take a look at these great tips from the acne prevention experts at Nature's Cure. Oily hair can aggravate acne, so stay away from oily products like pomades or hair spray, especially if you want to get rid of pimples on your forehead. If your hair is long, wear it pulled back or consider a shorter style that keeps it off your face, neck and shoulders if acne prevention is important in those areas. Be sure to pull your hair away from your skin when you sleep so that pimples don't develop overnight. Use \"noncomedogenic\" (won't clog pores or cause blackheads) or \"nonacnegenic\" (won't cause pimples) cosmetics and suntan lotions. Avoid using moisturizers on acne-prone areas to get rid of pimples you have there or practice good acne prevention; if you do use a moisturizer, make sure it is not acnegenic. Use topical treatments, such as Nature's Cure medicated spray, anywhere that you tend to get breakouts for acne prevention - don't just spot-treat existing blackheads and pimples. The pore-clogging process happens two to three weeks before any blackheads or blemishes become visible on the skin. Since the salicylic acid acne medication in the body spray is an exfoliant, it helps to remove the dead skin that combines with oil and dirt to form those nasty blackheads and whiteheads that can get infected and become pimples. Wash the skin gently with a mild soap or cleanser and warm (not hot) water once or twice daily. Hot water and harsh cleansers can further irritate your skin and undermine your acne prevention efforts. It's tempting to try to scrub away acne, but that's not how to get rid of pimples. Scrubbing too hard or too frequently can actually make your acne worse and promote scarring by increasing inflammation or rupturing cysts under your skin, making bacteria spread. Don't pick acne or blackheads on your face or body. It can permanently scar your skin. If you must pick, immediately apply a topical antibiotic to help stave off infection. Since stress can trigger acne, try to avoid stressful situations, resolve stresses by talking to friends/family or a professional, and be sure to eat right and get enough sleep. Sometimes the stress of having acne and trying to figure out how to get rid of pimples can make things worse. But if you take action toward acne prevention with these tips, you can diffuse some of that stress. Exercising regularly can also help reduce stress and it increases blood circulation and oxygen penetration to the skin, which may help with acne prevention. Drink at least 64 ounces of water a day to help \"detoxify\" the body from the inside out. Avoid hot, humid environments such as poorly ventilated kitchens, gyms, or tropical climates and stay away as much as possible from cooking grease or machine oil that can contribute to blackheads and clogged pores. If you work out, bring along pre-moistened alcohol towelettes to wipe sweat off your face, back and chest. Use towels to cover neck and chest areas to prevent coming in direct contact with the equipment. If you want to know how to get rid of pimples on your body, you need to realize that bumps on chest and back can be caused by tight fitting workout clothes that trap moisture and heat, so wear loose-fitting all-cotton clothing when you work out. Wear loose fitting clothing whenever possible and try to avoid friction against the skin caused by helmets, straps, backpacks or handbags. Sweat combines with skin oils to trap dirt and bacteria in your pores, causing blackheads and pimples, so it's important to shower as soon as possible after you work out or sweat profusely. Clean cosmetic brushes regularly in soapy water and throw out old, contaminated makeup. Since bacteria is one of the key causes of acne, anything that keeps bacteria from touching your skin will help in acne prevention.

These additives are natural remedies that will keep your skin balanced to help you get rid of acne. ","keywords":" acne, face cream, skin, Scotty's cream, tree tea oil, borage oil, NKO ","article_body":" After you have washed your face with a chemical free soap, use an applicator to dip into Scotty's face cream or you favorite face cream.  Place the cream on your face and spread it all around.  Massage the cream into your face gently so the skin absorbs the oils in this cream. These oils will seal the pores and hold the natural moisture of the skin and enhance the curing effects of the cream You can use the cream 2-3 times a day.  It is best to use it after you have cleaned your face in the morning and right before you go to bed.  You can also use it during noontime. You can use Scotty's' cream under your makeup or over your makeup.  It will work either way.  However, it will work better on a clean face. You will notice that when you apply the cream it will tingle in areas without sores and may sting in areas of open sores.  This will pass and as it does it should reduce the itchiness of any sores. Scotty's cream has allantoin, which will help to clear acne sores.  The oils, vitamin A and E, and minerals in Scotty's will help to feed, rebuild, and rejuvenate your skin.  The minerals also help to neutralize the toxic acids that have contaminated and inflamed pores on your face. During cleansing and fasting, more acid waste may come out of your pores.  This is why Scotty's cream will help you to reduce the inflammation and spread your acne. Tree Tea Oil To make Scotty's cream or your own cream even more powerful, you can add 5-10 drops of pure tree tea oil to a two-ounce container.  You can experiment with the amount to add.  You may want to add more drops to provide more tea tree oil for your face.  But, do not use more than 15 drops. Tree tea oil has been found to be effective in various skin disorders.  It acts as an antiseptic, antifungal, and antibacterial.  This oil helps to bring oxygen to the skin cell, which kills bacteria and fungus and helps to repair damaged skin caused by acne. Borage Oil There is one more thing that you can add to Scotty's face cream or your favorite acne cream that will boost its acne clearing power.  This is borage oil.  Borage oil contains EPA and DHA, which helps to control excessive hormones that cause the over production of sebum. It is the adrenal glands that produce streams of androgens during puberty.  These large quantities of androgens help to activate bone growth and assist in bringing forth sexual maturity. A side effect of these androgens is the release of excess oil from the oil glands near the hair follicle.  This excess gives rise to §\tblack heads §\twhite heads §\tpimples §\tcysts So here's what you can do to make your face cream even more effective, §\tMix one or two capsules of Borage oil into your cream §\tDo this by cutting the tip off of the Borage oil softgel and squeeze the oil into the cream There is a new form of EPA and DHA that is available in a product called Neptune Krill Oil (NKO) Neptune Krill Oil (NKO) NKO is the new EPA and DHA product, which maybe better to use than Borage Oil.  NKO has the omega-3, EPA and DHA in the phospholipid form, which is easier for your cells to absorb compared with Borage oil.  Borage oil contains the omega-3, EPA, and DHA in triglyceride form, which is more difficult for cells to absorb. One other good property of NKO is that is does not have to be refrigerated like Borage.  It can be kept in a cool place in your cabinets.  However, it does cost more than Borage oil. Word of Caution  As with all creams and oils, if you get any rash or skin reactions when using them, discontinue their use. Use a good face cream to help clear your acne.  You can boost the power of this cream by adding tree tea oil and borage or NKO oil.

When you are deficient in the essential fatty acids, you will have, §\tA weaken immune system §\tInflammatory disorders §\tPoor skin §\tSkin eruptions that won't heal §\tIncrease sebum production causing acne §\tSebaceous glands size increase Eating essential oils is necessary to provide the right oils that are used in the sebaceous glands.  These oils can come from straight vegetable oils or from oils in specific foods such as nuts and seeds. Use flax seed oil (omega-3 oil) and olive oil (omega-6 oil) in your salad.  These are the best oils to eat and are called polyunsaturated fatty acids.  The other oil that is even better for you is called monounsaturated fatty acid, omega-9.  This oil is found in avocados. Most diets people have contain an excess of omega-6 oils, so mostly likely you need to concentrate on getting more omega-3 oils into your diet. You can get omega-3 oil from, §\tavocados §\tsesame seeds §\tpumpkin seeds §\twalnuts §\tdark leafy green vegetables (spinach, mustard greens, kale) §\twheat germ oil §\tsalmon §\tsardines §\talbacore tuna Or, you can take one to 4 tablespoon of flax seed oil, omega-3 oil, each day.  This will give you the amount of omega-3 oil that your body needs to reduce or eliminate acne blemishes.  You can add this oil to your morning cereal, soups, smoothies, salads and other liquid foods.  Each tablespoon of flax seed oil contains about 100 calories. You can get omega-6 oil from, §\tFlaxseed oil §\tFlaxseeds §\tgrape seed oil §\tpistachio nuts §\tolives §\tolive oil §\tsunflower seeds §\tevening primrose oil §\tpumpkin seeds Taking 2-3 tablespoons of omega-6 oil a day will give you the amount of this oil that you body needs.

Fish Oils In addition to supplying your diet with omega-3 and omega-6 oils, you need to supplement your diet with fish oils.  Fish oil contains EPA and DHA fatty acids. Normally, enzymes in your body break down omega-6 into  EPA and DHA fatty acids. Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) These two fatty acids eventually change into prostaglandins. What are prostaglandins? Prostaglandins are chemical hormones that come from omega-3 and omega-6 oils and that help, regulate every function in your cells and organs. Postaglandins also keep androgen hormones in control so that excess sebum is not produce in the hair follicle, which results in acne. However, eating plenty essential fatty acids may not insure that you produce enough EPA and DHA, which produce the essential prostaglandins. It is critical for acne and more importantly for your health that you get enough EPA and DHA in your cells and organs so they can produce the required prostaglandins. To increase the prostaglandins in your cell walls, it is necessary for you to take a fish supplement, which contains both the EPA and DHA. Of course eating salmon, halibut, and mackerel twice a week will be a plus in providing your body with more EPA and DHA. Include at least 20% of your diet calories as good fats - omega oils and fish oil.  This is essential for controlling the excess activity of your hormones and reducing the inflammation of your acne.

If the doctors were right about food and the colon, then they would easily be able to help you clear your acne with their drugs.  Drugs can give you temporary relief, it they work at all, but as you use them they can also give you some unpleasant side effects. In her book, Food And Healing, 1986, Annemarie Colbin, points out, \"In a systems view of the body, input of all kinds relates to output of all kinds.  Food, therefore, would have a definite relationship to matter pushed out through the skin.  I am continually amazed that dermatologists persist in viewing the skin as merely a protective envelope for the body, ascribing its eruptions to 'viruses' and imprecise malfunctions and supporting the myth that 'diet has nothing to do with acne.' In my experience, diet has everything to do with acne.  Not only did I fix my own bad skin through correct eating but I have seen among my students a number of severe cases - the large purplish kind of acne on cheeks and chins - completely cured within three months by a change of diet.\" Foods to Stop Eating If you smoke, drink alcohol or drink coffee, then this program will not work too well for you.  When you have these addictions, your body's minerals and vitamins will be out of balance and it will be difficult for you to achieve any state of good health. So, here are they foods that you need to stop eating.  You don't need to stop eating these foods instantly.  Not many people can do this.  You need to do this gradually.  I know it will be hard to stop eating some of these foods that you have enjoyed, over the years, but you have to ask yourself the question, \"Which do I want to be  …Acne free or a junk food addict?\" The choice is yours and I know you will make the right decision so here is the list, *   White Bread - This is considered junk food since it is void of any vitality for your body.  It is hard to digest and causes constipation *   Chocolate - some chocolates are better than others.  Those that have saturated fats such milk, butter and sugars are not good for your health and definitely not good for your skin. *   Fried Fatty foods - fried foods, butter, chesses, beef, *   Foods in packages - All foods in packages or boxes are junk food.  They are considered dead food and provide no life force to your body.  They take from you because they use up minerals, vitamins, and digestive enzymes during digestion.  They contain no fiber so they cause constipation. *   Foods with artificial flavors and preservatives - These are non-foods that are super toxic. Your body does not know what to do with them so it stores them in your body as toxic waste. *   Milk, ice cream, hard chesses - these foods cause allergies and cause mucus to form.  This mucus coats the colon and other internal surfaces and interferes with the function of that area.  Bacteria and other pathogens enjoy living in the mucus film. This mucus also tries to escape through the face when you have too much of it in the body.  If you cannot digest dairy products, this can cause you to have acne. *   Sodas are the worst drink you can take.  They contain plenty of sugar and phosphoric acid. *   Sugar is considered a white poison.  It creates so many health problems in the body that the FDA should outlaw it. *   Salt - avoid salt only because it has iodine.  Iodine has been shown to cause acne. *   Excess Vitamin B12 - can aggravate or produce acne. There you have it.  It takes a lot of will power and desire to change your diet.  It can be done but do it slowly.  Start changing your diet and see where you're at in 6 months.

Because meat and bread have little fiber, they move slowly in the colon, which leads to constipation and eventually to some type of colon inflammation. Bad bacteria, decaying meat and other undigested food contribute to the build up of toxic matter in the colon. This is the type of condition you should try to avoid, if you have acne.

Minerals Here are them most important minerals to take when you have acne. * Calcium Hydroxyapatite Complex – a tablet after each meal. * Chromium 200 – 500 ugm or micrograms a day * Mineral electrolytes * Zinc gluconate 25 – 60 mg a day (zinc is one of the most important nutrient to add to your diet) Zinc works to reduce the male sex hormone dihyrdrotestosterone (DHT), which in excess will produce acne. Do not take over 100 mg unless you consult with a Doctor. Word of Caution After you have gain relief from acne, you can discontinue the use of the above supplements and get back to your normal supplementation program. Continual use of high doses of vitamins and minerals will offset you natural body’s chemical balance and is detrimental to your health in the long run. Other Supplements There are seven special supplements that you should consider taking that can help you get rid of acne and to improve your overall health. These supplements will improve your immune system and help to clear and prevent future acne. Look at these supplements and take the one or ones that you feel will give you the most health benefits. * Oxygen Elements Plus * Electrolyte Minerals * Systemic Enzymes * Digestive enzymes * Flax Seed Oil * Lecithin * Chlorophyll and Lemon Oxygen Elements Plus (only this nutrient is discussed in this article) The skin needs plenty of oxygen to keep it clean and free of bacteria. Using a product like Oxygen Elements Plus gives you at least 10-20% more oxygen in your blood. Here’s where to get Oxygen Plus. The plus in this product are added minerals and other nutrients. Increasing the oxygen in your blood is now a necessity for normal health. Your body needs more oxygen than you presently get from the air you breathe so that your body functions normally. The amount of oxygen you have in your body that is available to you cells is dependent on many things such as, * Acid in the body * Nonfood waste products * Pathogens in the body These three items, acid, nonfoods, and pathogens use up your oxygen. The oxygen that is left over is then used for your body’s needs. So the more you have of these three items, the less oxygen you will have to supply your body’s needs. This results in more toxins in the blood and can prevent you having an acne free face.

Thoughts create those feelings that you sometimes don’t understand. Read on to find some insight as to how acne is created by your thinking. ","keywords":" acne, traumas, face ","article_body":" Your thoughts have a lot to do with why you have acne. Most people will not even give this idea a single thought. You can get rid of acne without changing your way of thinking, but your thoughts will create some other illness that you might not see. Most illnesses begin with the way you think, the way you are, or your basic philosophy. Your thoughts create chemicals that flow into your blood and affect the function of your entire body. So if you have acne, it was created by the way you think. If you have ulcers, heart problems, or anything else, these were created by the way you think. Your thinking prevents you from eating and doing the things that you need to do to have good health or clear clean skin. If you have acne or any disease, it is an opportunity for you to stop and think about why you have it. Acne is an expression of your thinking. Everything about you – the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you dress, that way you eat, the diseases you come down with, the way you do everything – originates in your thought process. Here is one place to start your self-examination. Start by being more accepting of yourself. What I have learned in the past is that no matter how much you put yourself down or how critical you are of yourself, it will not change the world around you. The world and you are still the same. So, just get over it. Stop fighting who you are. Accept yourself as you are and get on with the purpose of your life. Just get on with it. Don’t worry about what other people are thinking and doing. That’s their problem not yours. You need to learn how to “face yourself.” When you have acne you may not want to look at yourself and “face who you are?” If you have acne, there is always some underlying emotions and feelings that are being expressed by your acne. Look into yourself and try to see what you are saying with your acne. If you cannot find it, see if you can relate it to constipation. Constipation and a toxic colon is typically the cause of acne. But to go one-step further, all physical illness are created by some emotional unbalance that you are holding onto. Acne can be a representation of repressed traumas that you have experienced as a child when you were growing up. I know you may not want to hear this. But, Acne can be an expression of those traumas trying to burst out of the repressive mechanisms that your body creates to prevent you from facing these traumas until you are ready to do so. Some effort has to be make to connect and release these traumas, otherwise as you clear your face these traumas can move to some other parts of your body where they will be unseen and destroy tissue and body functions. If you have a negative thought, ask yourself this question, “does this thought or idea help me or others become a better person?” If not, then let go of this thought and move on to a better thought and a better place in your life. Good Luck To You Follow the 12 steps for getting rid of acne and you will get results. Follow these steps and your face will clear and become smooth and lovable.

In her extensive book, Coking For Healthy Healing, 1991, Linda Rector-page, N.D., Ph.D., talks about what a fast does, \"Fasting works by self-digestion.  During a cleanse, the body in its infinite wisdom, will decompose and burn only the substances and tissue that are damaged, diseased, or unneeded, such as abscesses, tumors, excess fat deposits, and congestive wastes.   Even a relatively short fast can accelerate elimination from the liver, kidneys, lungs and skin, often causing dramatic changes as masses of accumulated waste are expelled.  Live foods and juices can literally pick up dead matter from the body and carry it away.\" Day before the fast The day before the fast, eat a large salad and two apples.

I suffered from acne for over a decade of my life and this lingered way into adulthood, thus it wasn’t just a “puberty thing”. Imagine not being able to look in the mirror with ease, having to look down when speaking to people, hating to take photos and hang out with friends and family, all because of one crises Acne. Well, not anymore, I’ve been successful at getting rid of my pimples with simple methods and the aim of this article is to show acne sufferers how to achieve similar results naturally and in about a week…or less! Believe me, I tried the famous acne remedy product on TV that I’m sure every and any acne patient has heard of and probably tried to no avail. I even went as far as considering plastic surgery, that’s how desperate I was but as the saying goes “The best things in life are FREE…even when it comes to an acne remedy.” Characterized by bumps, excessively oily or dry skin, spots and embarrassing eruptions, acne remains a terrible skin disorder that sadly permits for exploitation from the many marketers and charlatans out to make a fast buck on the expense of the vulnerable. Even the so called natural approaches of acne treatment aimed at treating acne from within, are unrealistic, impractical and often pricey or are just the same one-dimensional gimmick cures disguised as holistic solutions. That said I will now outline the natural, common sense, and very inexpensive methods for a successful acne remedy naturally. ACNE REMEDY INTERNAL MEASURES FOR ACNE TREATMENT First and foremost, for not just overcoming this skin disorder, but for your all around health, you have to seriously consider making a change in your diet. “You are what you eat.” If your diet consists of only junk and fast foods, you are only wreaking havoc on your entire system of visceral organs ranging from the digestive tract to the excretory organs. That said; make it a point to adhere to eating what has been coined in the drugless fraternity as “the Mucus-Less/Alkaline Diet” which is made up of mostly Organic Seasonal Fruits, Fruit, Root and Leafy vegetables and as needed pure filtered water. Not only will this simple change in diet make for a clearer and smoother skin, it will also give the added benefit of improved health and overall wellness. A basic format for a suggested diet regimen when using the components listed above will be in the next installment of “Acne Remedy what worked for my acne was the drug-free way” Foras Aje is an independent researcher and author of Fitness Inside and out, a book on improving physical and mental health naturally.

"},{"title":" Acne Remedy What worked for my acne was the drug-free way (part 2) ","word_count":662,"summary":" For a successful internal acne treatment, i.e. curing acne from its root cause and core, to tell you to eat right will be an understatement and perhaps incomplete. When, what and how to ‘eat’ right are equally factors necessary for a successful treatment of acne internally. Learn what these factors are to empower yourself for a drug-free healing of acne. ","keywords":" Acne Remedy, Acne ","article_body":" In the hopes that you may have read the first installation of this series on acne treatment using drug free methods, I will now proceed to give you a suggested diet menu-plan to adhere to for an internal acne remedy program. This diet is based on the fact that the human body goes through a cleansing process from twelve midnight until twelve noon, and a building program from twelve noon to twelve midnight. Therefore, what is eaten during these respective periods must be harmonious with the natural processes. Following this dietetic suggestion will not only lend to a successful acne treatment process internally, but will also lead to an improvement in your overall health and fitness levels. Acne Remedy Suggested Diet Menu Plan Breakfast A choice of the following 1. A tall glass of Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice. 2. A tall glass of Fresh squeezed lemonade flavored with genuine maple Syrup (the darker the grade the better) Lunch A mono-meal of an organic fruit in season for example Apples in the fall and winter, Melons in the summer, Berries in spring. Dinner Fresh, home-made salads. A simple dressing could be (a) Lemon juice, olive oil and un-iodized sea-salt (b) Avocadoes or Green coconuts blended with  tomatoes and some sea salt Or Raw and/or cooked root vegetables such as Celery, Carrots, Potatoes, Plantains, raw or slightly heated fruit veggies (these can be blended into Soups or dressings for your salads) This format adheres to a scientifically proven principle that the human body goes through a cleansing process from twelve midnight until twelve noon, and a building program from twelve noon to twelve midnight, therefore your meals during these respective periods should be harmonious with the natural processes. To augment this simple dietetic change and to target the root cause of your acne, I will recommend what according to Philippus Paracelsus is “The greatest remedy-the physician within.”, that my friend is a Fast. Believe me, when I say this simple sacrifice was what sped up the success of my acne treatment in about 3 days…literally! It is not an error to say that it is a “cure-all” for every disease known to man-when practiced properly. Being radical in nature, there are several sources of information on the how’s, when’s, the types and definitions applicable to fasting on the internet and based on my experience, I have made a specific chapter for fasting in my e-book-although you can always type up Fasting or Juice Fasting in your favorite search engine for your edification on the subject. One more factor that I must add is BY ALL MEANS AVOID THE MICROWAVE. I learned this the hard-but thankfully-important way while engaging in a 2-week fast for spiritual reasons. I was using this device to heat up my water for the laxative tea that the fast involves and each time I consumed the tea, I immediately felt very weak and lethargic. “Perhaps I’m detoxifying” I thought, WRONG!  Not only was I extremely weak, the bumps that had since left me came right back and during this specific fasting period. Thankfully, my intuition was still intact so I analyzed everything I was consuming, gauged my previous experiences with fasting to this period and came to the conclusion that it had to be the use of a microwave, since it was the only different procedure I had included. That said, I used an electric stove instead and in less than 48 hours, the bumps were gone-never to return-and the expected strength that comes as an added benefit of fasting was now present. Microwave cooking is one of the most important causes of ill health so avoid this so called “convenience” device as well. Now that the internal aspects of your acne remedy have been addressed, I will address the external methods of acne treatment in the next installment of this series. It’s the last one my friend, but it is an integral part of curing your acne naturally.

I will recommend using purified water instead of regular tap water, to avoid inhaling the toxic chlorinated by-products it is notorious for. Perform this step for several minutes to induce heavy and effective perspiration. *Massage the face regularly as this not only aids in cleansing the face, but it firms up the skin and alleviates unwanted signs of aging such as crow’s feet, bags under the eyes, lines and wrinkles *Engage in some form of exercise to aid the body in detoxification and metabolism. *For my male readers; if you are of African or Hispanic descent, most barbers recommend you use electric clippers to shave. For Caucasians & Asians, I have observed that using razors might not be a problem although if you prefer, you can use electric clippers also.

There is no cure for acne rosacea, but medical therapy helps keeping it under control and reversing the symptoms. If you suspect you have rosacea, you should consult a dermatologist for diagnosis and treatment. What Are The Main Symptoms? Acne rosacea symptoms vary widely from one individual to another and generally only some of the potential sign appear. Experts claim that it always includes one of the following primary symptoms * Flushing * Persistent Redness * Bumps and Pimples * Visible Blood Vessels Acne Rosacea Treatment As signs and symptoms vary widely from one sufferer to another, acne rosacea treatment should be tailored by a dermatologist for each particular case. Dermatologists can prescribe various oral and topical treatments to cure pimples and redness associated with the disease. Generally, the initial treatment consists of oral antibiotics combined with topical treatment to bring the condition under control, followed by long-term topical treatment to maintain it. In some cases, laser or intense pulsed light therapy are used for acne rosacea treatment, in order to reduce redness, remove visible blood vessels and correct nose disfigurement. Ocular rosacea is usually treated with antibiotics. Skin Care Individuals who suffer from acne rosacea should consult their dermatologist to make sure the skin care treatment they are using is suitable for their condition. Patients are usually advised to use mild and non-abrasive cleaners to wash their face, rinse it with warm water and blot it dry using a soft cotton towel. They should only use non-irritating products and use a sunscreen with an SPF of minimum 15 to protect their skin from sunlight. If you have acne rosacea, you may use cosmetics to conceal the effects.

Lifestyle A healthy lifestyle is also part of the whole acne rosacea treatment and it can help you maintain remission and avoid the external factors that cause flare ups or aggravate your skin condition. Here are some of the things you should do * Avoid hot drinks, lots of coffee, spicy foods and alcohol. Although most people think acne rosacea is linked to alcoholism, it can also affect someone who doesn't drink at all. * Practice a good sun protection and avoid extremely high or low temperatures. * Avoid aggressive behavior against your face, such as rubbing or scrubbing, as it can irritate the reddened skin. * Work out only in cool environments and do not overheat. * Avoid cosmetics and skin-care products that irritate your skin and use hair sprays properly. * Try keeping a diary of all flushing episodes and write down what foods, products, medications ore activities are they associated with.

Consulting a dermatologist and getting the right treatment, as well as following these lifestyle guidelines, can decrease the risk of pustules and redness and help you keep the situation under control.

","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" Over the Counter Drugs Q I've tried a million over the counter products for acne and they work for a while and then they stop. I've tried oil-free cleansers, gels, cover-ups, and makeup - all of which claim they help acne-prone skin. But they're not; what am I doing wrong? A You're not doing anything wrong except wasting your money. The products you're buying don't work. Even though they are labeled oil-free, they really aren't oil-free. All products with the exception of water, are oil-based. Just like in the foods you eat, there are good oils and bad oils. The products that you have been using are full of bad oils and are producing new acne, not helping it. Over the counter eye shadows and lipsticks are fine, but when it comes to make-up and cleansers, the stuff you've been buying just isn't helping. Q What about all the acne soaps and astringents I use? I wash and scrub my face constantly, but I still break out. Why? A You can scrub all you want but it won't make a difference. Acne forms inside your hair follicles which are below the surface. The same thing goes for drying-out your skin with alcohol or astringents. All this does is clean the top layer of your skin, but it doesn't go inside the clogged hair follicles to clean them out. It's important to realize that your pimples are forming beneath the top layers of your skin and that over the counter products can't help you there. The Acne Treatment Clinic offers topical medications which go deep into the clogged hair follicles to clean them out and prevent new pimples from forming. Whether you suffer from severe acne or occasional breakouts, our products work quickly giving you positive results. Q I've tried just about everything for my skin. What do you put in your products that make them so different? A It's not what we put in them, it's what we don't put in them. Our products are formulated without adding oils to interfere with their effectiveness. The Acne Treatment Clinic has a safe, effective, and inexpensive skin care program that works. There are no side-effects, no sun-sensitivity, no pills, and no gimmicks. Q I'm very skeptical about new products, especially since everything I've used up till now hasn't worked. What is your success rate? How long have you been in business and most of all, do you have any idea how I feel!? A I know these products work because I suffered from acne for 25 years. It destroyed my self-confidence, made me feel unattractive and was just plain ruining my life! After graduating from the University of California at Berkeley, I did some research, hired a chemist, and opened the Acne Treatment Clinic. We have been in Northern California for over ten years and have successfully treated over 5,000 men and women of all ages. When many of our graduating high school seniors went off to college, we started sending their products to them by mail. Word spread on campuses all across the state and country and soon we opened our mail order division. Now with the Internet, we are able to send our products all over the world. I must have the most rewarding job in the world, because I know exactly how it feels to have acne and know exactly how great it is to clear it up! Q Do all your clients use the same products? A No. Everyone's skin is different. That's why the Acne Treatment Clinic offers a variety of products, all formulated for specific skin types and problems. Many factors determine your treatment which is customized for you. That's why we ask you to please fill out the questionnaire on the How to Order page so we can personally help you. Q  Are chocolate and greasy foods really bad for my skin? A No! How could anyone live without chocolate or French fries? Food Q Is there a connection between what I eat and my acne? A Yes, it helps to eat a well balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals with plenty of water. This is paramount to having a healthy body and a good complexion. Splurging on bad food once in awhile is no big thing, as long as you eat well most of the time. However, some people have that backwards. The stress you put on your body if you mistreat it by not eating right, smoking, doing drugs, over-doing the alcohol or caffeine is enough to aggravate even the most mild acne case. Prescription Drugs Q Why don't antibiotics work for acne? A Antibiotics work for getting rid of an infection, like strep throat. When it comes to treating acne, all topical and oral drugs are doing is temporarily killing the bacteria, which eventually become resistant to the antibiotic. A common practice is to prescribe the topical ointment, Retin-A® in conjunction with antibiotics. Unfortunately, many people experience redness and irritation which actually cause more pimples and blackheads to form. Because Retin-A® and antibiotics make your skin very sun-sensitive they are not practical for many acne sufferers. Another drug often prescribed for acne is Accutane®. This is just a temporary solution to your acne, but it's not a long term and safe alternative to controlling your breakouts. And if not helping acne isn't enough, some antibiotics also reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. Check with your doctor. Q What should I expect to see after using your products for a couple of months? AYou will definitely look better. Your pimples will be smaller, go away faster, and you should have fewer of them. Our products will prevent new pimples from forming and will reduce the swelling and irritation on your skin from your breakouts. We stand behind our products, and if for any reason you are not happy with them we will refund your money. They get to the root of the problem and work. At the Acne Treatment Clinic our products are specially formulated for problem skin. That's all we do - is treat your type of skin. We are specialists in acne and only acne. Sun Q If the sun is so damaging to my skin, then why does it seem to clear up my acne? A It's not helping clear up your acne at all. The \"tan\" look is just a temporary coloring that appears to hide your pimples. But when the tan goes away, the zits stay. Worse yet, the sun tans your scars darker and sets you up for a whole new crop of pimples! Sun damages your skin and that's all there is to it. True, you might look better and feel better with a tan, but what you're doing is creating new pimples for three or four months down the road - that's how long it takes for a pimple to form. It's not a fluke that your skin looks worse in October when your summer time tan catches up with you. That's why it is important to wear one of our specially formulated sunscreens to help prevent future breakouts. Q I try to remember and wear sunscreen, but every time I wear it my skin breaks out worse. What's the story? A Good sunscreen is good, but bad sunscreen is bad. If you're wearing acne aggravating sunscreen, then you're not helping the situation. Most of the over the counter sunscreens you've probably been using are loaded with oils which clog your skin. This produces acne. The Acne Treatment Clinic only has non-acne aggravating sunscreens, that not only protect your skin from harmful UV rays, but don't cause acne. Remember that a sunscreen is JUST that screen. You need to apply your sunscreen at least a half hour before sun exposure and re-apply it at least every two hours to receive the maximum protection. Also, it never hurts to wear a wide-brimmed hat or sit under a tree. Acne or not, the sun harms your skin. Men Only Q  I work out and sweat a lot. I always have pimples on my back but rarely on my face. How can I avoid them altogether? ASweat aggravates acne, however, there are a few things you can do to minimize your breakouts. First of all, avoid sport drinks at all costs! Most sport drinks contain high amounts of iodine which has been shown to flare-up pimples when excreted through the skin in the form of sweat. Drinking lots of water during exercise helps minimize this problem. Wear clean, loose-fitting clothing during your workout because believe it or not, friction makes pimples bigger. Last, but not the least, you must try to shower at least 1/2 hour after exercise using one of our cleansers for acne prone areas. Q After working out and showering, it feels like the soap didn't cut the oil and sweat on my skin - especially on my back. Any suggestions? A The Acne Treatment Clinic's medicated cleansers are perfect for the job. They are adequate for both the face and body and thoroughly clean your skin without leaving behind any slimy residue. Best of all, they're not very expensive, last a long time, lather-up great, and really work. QMy skin seems to break out only where I shave. Why, and what can I do to stop this? A If you are using a double edged razor, then STOP! Double edged blades cut the hair beneath the surface and cause trauma and subsequent breakouts. Try using a single-edged razor and shave in the direction of your hair growth. Also, you need to stop using your current shaving cream because it's probably aggravating your skin. We've seen the best results when men switch to one of our foaming facial cleansers and use it as their shaving cream. Never put cologne or aftershave on areas where you frequently break out because these products contain oils which will aggravate your acne. It is also advisable to use topical medications on a daily basis to prevent future breakouts as well. The products we sell at the Acne Treatment Clinic can be worn during the day so you are treating your acne around the clock without anybody knowing it but you. Q I'm 34 years old, have 2 kids, 1 house, 1.3 dogs and 800 zits! I was always looking forward to trading in my pimples for wrinkles, but it's starting to look like I'll be stuck with both. Why? AAcne is a genetic skin problem and aging won't get you out of this one. While it's true that the older you get the flare-ups usually become less severe, they're still unwanted and often embarrassing. Most acne sufferers go between times of flare-ups and clear skin their whole lives. Fortunately, the Acne Treatment Clinic has a safe, long-term treatment for controlling your acne. Sorry, we can't do anything about controlling your kids! Women Q Can anyone tell when I'm wearing your products? ANo. All our products, with the exception of the masks, are invisible on your skin. We don't expect you to stop your life so you can go home and treat your pimples. Q Why do I always break out about a week before my period? My pimples are large and hurt and seem to be located around my mouth and chin. Also, sometimes they pop up on my neck. A Hormones, hormones, hormones. It is very common to breakout along the lower half of your face and neck because of hormones. Regular periods and regular break-outs go hand in hand, however, if you're having irregular periods, the imbalance of hormones could make your skin worse. Also, where acne is concerned, some birth control pills are less acne aggravating than others. The good news is that you can effectively control most premenstrual breakouts using Acne Treatment Clinic products. Diligent use of the topical medications 30 days every month, insures your skin stays clear every day of the month -- even when you have your period. Stress and Emotions Q   When I'm stressed or burned out, my acne gets worse. What does one thing have to do with the other? A Whether it's from relationship problems, an unbalanced diet, lack of sleep, your job, or school pressures, stress aggravates acne. You may be able to control some stress, but unfortunately stress is a part of life. That's why it's important to have a skin care program that's easy to use and helps to fight off stress-induced pimples. Acne Treatment Clinic products are specially formulated to prevent pimples.

Answer While certain types of acne do contain a bacterium, it is located in the hair follicles under your skin and can not be transmitted through contact. So no, touching or kissing someone with acne will not cause you to develop acne. 2.) If both my parents had acne does that mean I will develop acne? Answer Studies show that heredity does play an important role in determining who develops acne. So children of parents who had or have acne are at a grater risk then others. It should be noted that as with any disease just because you have a family history, does not guarantee you will get it; only that you have a much great chance then someone with no family history. 3.) Does eating or drinking certain foods cause acne? Answer Over the years studies have suggested everything from chocolate, candy, fried foods, sugar, drinking water, orange juice to milk can cause you to develop acne or make existing acne worse. However their is no scientific evidence to support any such results. There are so many factors effecting acne development that it is very difficult to isolate any one cause. So whether or not to avoid certain foods or drinks is really just an individual preference. If you find your skin reacts negatively to certain foods, then just don’t eat or drink it. 4.) Does dirt on my skin cause acne? Answer Having proper hygiene will help with healthy skin. However dirty skin will not cause acne, but anybody with acne should be extra vigilant in having a good cleansing routine. Over washing can irritate your skin and make it more vulnerable to infection. Washing with a gentle cleanser will help reduce skin cell build up and keep your skin looking at its best. So find a balance and try not to over wash. 5.) Does stress cause acne? Answer Stress has been shown to make acne worse, not directly cause it. So if you suffer from acne you should be aware of how you react under stress and develop ways to help manage and keep it under control. This will not only help with controlling your acne but also benefit your over all health. 6.) Can you develop acne once you are out of your teens? Answer The simple answer is yes. In fact many people who never experienced acne as a teen can develop it in their 30, 40, and 50’s. 7.) Does make up or sunscreen make acne worse? Answer Certain products that are overly greasy and thick can plug the skins follicles leading to the development of acne. Not all products affect everyone the same way, so while you many develop acne using one product someone else may not. If you are prone to acne you will need to be extra careful with what you put on your skin. Try to always use oil free products and also test a small amount on a patch of skin for a few days before using it all over. 8.) Will exercising affect my acne? Answer While it is still unclear why this happens, vigorous exercising that causes your body to heat up and sweat does seem to cause acne to get worse for certain people. One theory is that exercise increases the production of sebum, the oil that when to much is produced can lead to acne. 9.) Can a facial help with acne? Answer There is no easy way to answer this question. The term facial is used to describe everything from an over the counter product you buy from a drug store and do it yourself to something done at an expensive spa for hundreds of dollars. The bottom line is anything that might irritate your skin can make your acne worse. 10.) Why does my acne stop responding to my current treatment? Answer Acne medication, like all medications can become less effective over time as your body builds a resistance to them. It might be necessary to use acne treatment regiments on a rotational basis for optimum effectiveness.

","keywords":" acne scar laser treatment,acne ","article_body":" Copyright 2006 Alberto Martinez I  didn’t know anything about acne scar laser treatment to remove, blend, or diminish the pocks and other marks, then.  It was the 1980s, and I was not all that focused on beauty (but rather on getting through graduate school, therapy, and three jobs); and I was ignorant about skin care innovations.  But I said to the man of the week, a cool guy, actually, for most purposes, that I wanted to sand-paper my face skin, so I could lesson the devastating holes…or at least so I could fill in the open pores, the holes where acne had been. Think of the face as being made of clay.  Imagine that clay face full of big gouges, dents, or blemishes—new and old.  Envision taking a stylus or other sculptor’s tool to drag and smear new clay into those pits and over those scars and marks.  It seems logical, right?  Your new face would be pock-free and smooth again, as it had been in pre-adolescent days.  If you think of the new techniques, surgical, cosmetic, and other, used to remove acne marks, you might think in terms of the sculptor’s clay and maneuvers analogy.  Then again, you might think more in terms of the face as an unfinished or marked piece of furniture that about to get sand-papered.  Not all that “imaginative” or, rather, new, today, though.  Now we have such a re-sculpting device we have acne scar laser treatment. Acne scar laser treatment, also called resurfacing and also used for wrinkles, works in a particular way.  According to one plastic surgery professional, acne scar laser treatment done by a CO2 laser or an erbium laser—which “vaporizes” superficial damaged skin cells.  This frees up the existing and healthier collagen to get thicker and to become even healthier. The emphasis honest practitioners of acne scar laser treatment offer, though, is that such treatment does not “cure” or magically remove all acne marks and blemishing.  Rather, it improves the skin condition, diminishing though not completely removing. Other details are equally important.  Depending upon type of acne scar laser treatment, be prepared to accept the treatment as a kind of surgery.  You might undergo sedation or anesthesia of some type or degree; you can expect to be in the outpatient treatment room for anywhere from fifteen to ninety minutes; and you will need anywhere from three days to three weeks to wait for the swelling to go down and the abrasions, redness, and/or oozing to stop completely so you can resume typical skin care. I certainly didn’t envision such a complicated process.  Then again, I didn’t come up with the idea all by myself, evidently.  And besides, I am not a doctor, nor do I play one when writing.

For many individuals, acne scar removal is the best solution to having scars removed from their body. Many individuals spend years dealing with acne in one form or the next. They find that there are many products on the market that do little to actually help them to remove acne. Acne scars can be devastating to their self esteem and outward appearance. Many individuals will deal with confidence issues because of their scars. Yet, acne scar removal can be the exact answer to their needs. How Do They Work? Selecting the right product for acne scar removal is important in the process. What individuals need to know is how the product actually works. For some situations, the product will work by exfoliating the skin enough to create new skin growth in the area of the scar. When the new skin heals, the scar will be gone or much less noticeable. These exfoliating products work well for many. Often, this acne scar treatment is called a chemical peel. There are both natural and chemical forms of this type of acne scar treatment. Many of them work in the same method with the goal of removing the top layers of skin to help improve the skin’s condition. Other products work by gently and effectively removing the scar through topical treatments. In any case, the method for which the acne treatment works should provide some results rather quickly. How To Select The Appropriate One When selecting an acne scar removal product, insure that you understand how the product works. Find out how it will work to remove the scars on your body. Also, insure that you are not allergic to anything in the product. If you are unsure, test the product on a small area of skin to see if there is a reaction within a day’s time. Also, you should notice where the removal treatment is used. Some are not meant for the face while others will not be able to be used on the neck or body. Acne scar removal can actually help to reform the skin and the soul when it is selected wisely. "},{"title":" Acne Scar Removal Tips ","word_count":383,"summary":" A simple ways of removing acnes.

However, those who are left with scars often look for acne scar removal methods that work to remove or diminish the scars. Fortunately, there are many options available for acne scar removal. Acne scar removal can be by dermabrasion. This is a process where the top layers of the skin are removed with the use of a machine that literally abrades the skin. While dermabrasion does give your skin a smoother appearance, it is not 100% effective for acne scar removal. Chemical peels are another option for acne scar removal. This works much the same as dermabrasion, but instead of machinery, chemicals are used to remove the top layer of skin. Again, this is not 100% effective for acne scar removal, but it does give the skin a smoother appearance. Another technique for acne scar removal is collagen injections. Collagen injections are often used to treat wrinkles, scars, and lines. Injections can be expensive, and will need to be repeated on a regular basis. This is another acne scar removal technique that doesn't actually remove the scars. It really just hides them. A drastic acne scar removal procedure is Autologous Fat Transfer. This is a process where fat is removed from other parts of your body, and injected back into your skin. It doesn't remove scars. Instead, it fills up depressions, such as those that are characteristic of acne scars. Again, this is a drastic acne scar removal method, and the process will need to be repeated as the fat is absorbed into the body. Another drastic acne scar removal technique is punch grafts. This is a process where small skin grafts are taken and used to replace scarred skin. This acne scar removal technique is usually used to remove deep acne scars. The newest - and seemingly most effective - acne scar removal technique is Laser Skin Resurfacing. This is a process where the acne scarred skin is gently vaporized, with the use of a laser. Once the damaged skin is vaporized, the new - unscarred - skin underneath is visible. Local anesthesia is given for small areas, but for full face acne scar removal, the person is usually sedated with anesthesia administered through an I.V by an anesthesiologist.

When acne eventually heals, it leaves ugly blemishes called acne scars. These become permanent if they are not treated in time. Acne scars are damaging to the ego and personality of an individual, and a lot of time and money has been invested in research to treat this problem. Acne scars are classified by size, shape and appearance they are identified as Icepick, Boxcar and Rolling. They are also tagged as early or permanent on the basis of their duration. Early scars respond well to topical medications. Permanent scars require surgical intervention. Presently, scars are treated with combinations of topical skin care medications in tandem with carefully selected surgical and skin resurfacing procedures. At least a half dozen surgical procedures are also performed to repair acne scars. Each has benefits and pitfalls and a surgeon will closely examine the patient’s age, sex, medical history, skin type and type of scarring before agreeing to perform surgery.  Cost is also discussed, as it can be quite expensive. When dermal fillers are used, a surgeon will inject fillers such as collagen and hyaluronic acid derivatives into the skin. This raises the base of the scar to the level of normal skin. The “punch excision” procedure is used in icepick and boxcar type scars and relies on making incisions in the skin with a punch biopsy tool and stitching the skin edges together. The new scar heals, leaving a clear skin. Punch excision with skin graft replacement is a variant of the punch excision method. Instead of suturing the skin after excision, surgeons use a skin graft to repair the scar. Punch elevation is used on deep boxcar scars that have sharp edges and normal appearing bases. Here the base of the scar is excised and elevated to the surface of the skin. Sutures and glue are used to join the edges together. Subcutaneous Incision is used for treating rolling scars and centers on the use of a special beveled needle that is inserted under the skin and used to cut the binding tissue in the scar. The resulting bruises fade after about 1 week. Laser resurfacing is used to burn the top layer of the skin and reduce it to the same level as the base of the scars. Prevention is always better than cure. Simple precautions such as avoiding strong sunlight, using medications like tretinoin and alpha hydroxyl acids, avoiding picking scabs, regular exercising and dietary control go a long way in preventing acne scars and saving a lot of embarrassment and expenses.

","keywords":" Acne Treatment, Laser Acne Treatment, Acne Scar Treatment, Adult Acne Treatment ","article_body":" Acne scars develop after severe cases or when the acne has been forcibly picked or scratched. There are many types of acne scars, each entirely treatable. The only sure method of acne scar treatment is prevention early on. In general, you should never pick or squeeze acne, especially inflammatory acne or “pustules”. Squeezing forces infected material deeper into the skin, causing additional inflammation and possible scarring. But there are many acne scar treatment options. All acne scar treatments are short procedures – fifteen minutes to an hour – but recovery times vary from fifteen minutes to many months. Scabbing, redness, swelling, flakiness, dryness, bruising and uneven skin tone are common post-treatment effects. Acne scar treatment can cost anywhere from $50 to over $3000. Ask a dermatologist which type of acne scar treatment is right for you. Dermabrasion works on shallow acne scars. For decades, sandpaper was used to scrape away damaged skin, allowing new skin to grow in its place, but now machines with rotating diamond edged wheels are used. Laser resurfacing is a newer resurfacing technique, with the same effects as dermabrasion. Penetration depth into the skin is more easily controlled with a laser than with dermabrasion and other methods. Chemical peels are designed only for the lightest of cases. It involves application of different types of acid to the skin in order to remove the top layer so that a smoother layer can surface. Punch techniques are used for deep acne scars. Punch replacement or excision involves removing the pitted scar, followed by a skin graft or suture. Punch elevation, on the other hand, just cuts the scar loose and allows it to float up to the level of surrounding skin. Subcision is a method whereby the scar tissue is broken up underneath the surface of the skin, forming a pool of blood under the scar. The blood clot helps form connective tissue under the scar, leveling it with the surface. Dermal fillers are used for deeper acne scars. Material - often collagen or fat – is injected under the scar to bring it to surface level. Injections usually last about six months, although research into the longer lasting materials continues to this day.

Although acne itself is not curable, even the most severe cases can be treated effectively.  For these sever conditions, various types of acne scar treatment are available if warranted by the situation. Recent estimates indicate that 85% of the population between the ages of 12 and 24 suffer from acne. The severity and amount of time a person has acne can vary from person to person, but for most of us, it will eventually go away by itself. It is true that even mild acne may affect normal social activities because of the undesirable changes to your appearance, but this is considered more of a nuisance than anything else. Unfortunately, there are more severe forms of acne with greater consequences. In addition to being painful, sever cases of acne can cause serious scarring. Acne scars can occur in both mild acne or severe acne, but the chances of scarring increases as the acne severity increases.  Luckily, you have the option of choosing between several acne scar treatment techniques available. The purpose of acne scar treatment is to restore your skin to its original appearance. You will find, however, that restoration is not always 100%, but acne scar treatment works to make the scarring almost invisible. There are a variety of techniques available to remove acne scars and each one uses a different approach. It is recommended that you consult with a dermatologist to determine the best technique based on your type of acne and the severity of scarring present. At this point, you may be asking yourself how acne scars occur. In general, acne scars, and other types of scars for that matter, result from tissue damage. After tissue is damaged, the body will begin healing itself and in the process discourages any chance of infection. Your body sends a special chemical call collagen to the affected area. Sometimes, the collagen is produced in excess and develops into an irregularly shaped fibrous mass resulting in an acne scar. Other types of scars that may also occur include soft scars, depressed scars, \"ice-pick\" scars, atrophic macules, and many others. For the most part, these types of scars are caused by the loss of tissue from a particular area. Injecting collagen under the surface of the scarred skin is one of the most popular acne scar treatment techniques being used. The purpose of this technique is to puff out or restore the skin, which makes the scar much less noticeable. Another acne scar treatment technique is called autologus fat transfer. This process uses the fat from one part of your body for injection into the affected area. This helps to fill in the scar, but since fat is eventually absorbed into the body, repeated applications may be needed. Other effective acne scar treatments include laser or dermabrasion. Skin grafting and even surgery is a possibility, but these procedures are used only used in the most extreme cases. Hopefully, you will not have to undergo any of these techniques to address your acne, but if scarring is present, with the help of your dermatologist you will be able to make an effective choice.

","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" There are many ways to treat acne scars. Determining your treatment depends on the type of scar and quantity of scarring. Before you consider a scar treatment you should have an in depth conversation with your doctor. It is very important you only use this information as an introduction to scar treatments and not a final guide. Your dermatologist and you can discuss the proper treatment after you have basic knowledge. For very mild acne, a chemical peel might be all that you need. Different types of acid are used in this procedure. It is recommended that you choose another method of treatment, if you have very noticeable or deep scarring. The chemical peel procedure takes about fifteen minutes. The resultant facial redness may last up to a few weeks. There are a few choices available to treat moderate acne scarring. The most popular are dermabrasion and laser resurfacing. Dermabrasion is a scar treatment in which a diamond plated wheel is used to “sand” your face. This technique has been around for a long time and sandpaper was once used instead of the new machines that utilize the diamond plated tool. Generally, this procedure takes around an hour to perform. You should expect some scabbing and redness for a few weeks. This method is most effective for individual with very pale or very dark complexions. The other treatment for mild acne scars is laser resurfacing. This treatment involves removing old skin with a carbon dioxide (CO2) or erbium laser. Depending on the size and frequency of the scars, the treatment may last only several minutes or in excess of an hour. This treatment is not advised for people with darker skin pigment, because it may result in uneven skin color. After treatment, redness should be expected for a few weeks and a mild pinkish tone may be evident even longer. For very deep, pitted scars, physicians utilize a \"punch technique.\" There are several \"punch\" treatments available depending on your doctor, type of acne and other factors. The first type is a punch replacement in which a tool is used to remove the scar. Then a skin graft from another part of your body is transplanted over the site. Another technique is the punch excision where the scar is surgically removed and the area allowed to recover. Finally, there is a technique where the physician removes the scar at the bottom. The skin at the treated area is allowed to rise and fills the cratered area. Usually a punch technique is combined with dermabrasion or laser resurfacing for optimal results. Healing may take up to several weeks. Another type of acne scar treatment is subcision. With subcision the scar is detached from the lower tissue, which allows a blood clot to form under the skin. The clot forces the scar up to the surface of the skin. Similar to the punch techniques, combining subcision with dermabrasion or laser resurfacing yields the best results. This type of treatment can be effective for all types of scarring, but is best for deeper and more prominent scars. The last type of treatment is augmentation. Augmentation uses a material similar to collagen which is injected under the skin to bring the scar to the surface. Recovery is immediate and no time off work is necessary. The drawback, however, is that results are temporary and only last up to six months. Whatever acne scar treatment you decide upon, keep in mind that some may require more than one session with a doctor. Always consult your dermatologist to decide which treatment is best for you. There is a wide variation with the costs associated with the various treatments. Make sure you consider the financial ramifications with your treatment plan before you proceed. Remember, more than one treatment plan may be effective in your particular situation. Each plan has benefits and drawbacks so make sure you discuss all your concerns with your doctor.

There are various scar treatments to remove the mark – ·Dermabrasion – A high-speed rotary wire brush or diamond-coated fraise is used to remove the top layer of the skin to make the scar look less pitted. This is done by a cosmetic surgeon. ·Microdermabrasion – It involves blasting tiny crystals at the skin and rubbing the skin with a rough tool. ·Laser resurfacing – The top layer of the skin is burnt off by a laser. ·Punch excision – A punch tool is used, with the help of which the scar is excised, and the edges are sutured together. ·Chemical peels – Glycolic, salicylic, or lactic are applied to the skin to get a smoother layer in an acid peel. ·Subcision – A deep pool of blood is created under the scar by detaching the scar from deeper tissue. This blood helps form a connective tissue under the scar, thus levelling it with the surface. ·Dermal filler – An injectable filler is used to fill up the scar. Mantaining a good hygeine with proper diet and medications help to reduce the occurance of acme, thus boosting your confidence level and self esteem.

","keywords":" acne. acnes, faqs, faq, FAQ, FAQS, ACNE, ACNES ","article_body":" A detailed and comprehensive discussion of acne scars starts with causes of scarring, prevention of scarring, types of scars, and treatments for scars. Before talking about scars, a word about spots that may look like scars but are not scars in the sense that a permanent change has occurred. Even though they are not true scars and disappear in time, they are visible and can cause embarrassment. Macules or \"pseudo-scars\" are flat, red or reddish spots that are the final stage of most inflamed acne lesions. After an inflamed acne lesion flattens, a macule may remain to \"mark the spot\" for up to 6 months. When the macule eventually disappears, no trace of it will remain—unlike a scar. Post-inflammatory pigmentation is discoloration of the skin at the site of a healed or healing inflamed acne lesion. It occurs more frequently in darker-skinned people, but occasionally is seen in people with white skin. Early treatment by a dermatologist may minimize the development of post-inflammatory pigmentation. Some post-inflammatory pigmentation may persist for up to 18 months, especially with excessive sun exposure. Chemical peeling may hasten the disappearance of post-inflammatory pigmentation. Causes of Acne Scars In the simplest terms, scars form at the site of an injury to tissue. They are the visible reminders of injury and tissue repair. In the case of acne, the injury is caused by the body’s inflammatory response to sebum, bacteria and dead cells in the plugged sebaceous follicle. Two types of true scars exist, as discussed later (1) depressed areas such as ice-pick scars, and (2) raised thickened tissue such as keloids. When tissue suffers an injury, the body rushes its repair kit to the injury site. Among the elements of the repair kit are white blood cells and an array of inflammatory molecules that have the task of repairing tissue and fighting infection. However, when their job is done they may leave a somewhat messy repair site in the form of fibrous scar tissue, or eroded tissue. White blood cells and inflammatory molecules may remain at the site of an active acne lesion for days or even weeks. In people who are susceptible to scarring, the result may be an acne scar. The occurrence and incidence of scarring is still not well understood, however. There is considerable variation in scarring between one person and another, indicating that some people are more prone to scarring than others. Scarring frequently results from severe inflammatory nodulocystic acne that occurs deep in the skin. But, scarring also may arise from more superficial inflamed lesions. Nodulocystic acne that is most likely to result in scars is seen in these photos (Photos used with permission of the American Academy of Dermatology National Library of Dermatologic Teaching Slides) The life history of scars also is not well understood. Some people bear their acne scars for a lifetime with little change in the scars, but in other people the skin undergoes some degree of remodeling and acne scars diminish in size. People also have differing feelings about acne scars. Scars of more or less the same size that may be psychologically distressing to one person may be accepted by another person as \"not too bad.\" The person who is distressed by scars is more likely to seek treatment to moderate or remove the scars. Prevention of Acne Scars As discussed in the previous section on Causes of Acne Scars, the occurrence of scarring is different in different people. It is difficult to predict who will scar, how extensive or deep scars will be, and how long scars will persist. It is also difficult to predict how successfully scars can be prevented by effective acne treatment. Nevertheless, the only sure method of preventing or limiting the extent of scars is to treat acne early in its course, and as long as necessary. The more that inflammation can be prevented or moderated, the more likely it is that scars can be prevented. (Click on Acne Treatments for more information about treatment of mild, moderate and severe acne). Any person with acne who has a known tendency to scar should be under the care of a dermatologist. (Click on Find a Dermatologist to locate a dermatologist in your geographic area). Types of Acne Scars There are two general types of acne scars, defined by tissue response to inflammation (1) scars caused by increased tissue formation, and (2) scars caused by loss of tissue. Scars Caused by Increased Tissue Formation The scars caused by increased tissue formation are called keloids or hypertrophic scars. The word hypertrophy means \"enlargement\" or \"overgrowth.\" Both hypertrophic and keloid scars are associated with excessive amounts of the cell substance collagen. Overproduction of collagen is a response of skin cells to injury. The excess collagen becomes piled up in fibrous masses, resulting in a characteristic firm, smooth, usually irregularly-shaped scar. The photo shows a typical severe acne keloid (Photo used with permission of the American Academy of Dermatology National Library of Dermatologic Teaching Slides) The typical keloid or hypertrophic scar is 1 to 2 millimeters in diameter, but some may be 1 centimeter or larger. Keloid scars tend to \"run in families\"—that is, abnormal growth of scar tissue is more likely to occur in susceptible people, who often are people with relatives who have similar types of scars. Hypertrophic and keloid scars persist for years, but may diminish in size over time. Scars Caused by Loss of Tissue Acne scars associated with loss of tissue—similar to scars that result from chicken pox—are more common than keloids and hypertrophic scars. Scars associated with loss of tissue are Ice-pick scars usually occur on the cheek. They are usually small, with a somewhat jagged edge and steep sides—like wounds from an ice pick. Ice-pick scars may be shallow or deep, and may be hard or soft to the touch. Soft scars can be improved by stretching the skin; hard ice-pick scars cannot be stretched out. Depressed fibrotic scars are usually quite large, with sharp edges and steep sides. The base of these scars is firm to the touch. Ice-pick scars may evolve into depressed fibrotic scars over time. Soft scars, superficial or deep are soft to the touch. They have gently sloping rolled edges that merge with normal skin. They are usually small, and either circular or linear in shape. Atrophic macules are usually fairly small when they occur on the face, but may be a centimeter or larger on the body. They are soft, often with a slightly wrinkled base, and may be bluish in appearance due to blood vessels lying just under the scar. Over time, these scars change from bluish to ivory white in color in white-skinned people, and become much less obvious. Follicular macular atrophy is more likely to occur on the chest or back of a person with acne. These are small, white, soft lesions, often barely raised above the surface of the skin—somewhat like whiteheads that didn’t fully develop. This condition is sometimes also called \"perifollicular elastolysis.\" The lesions may persist for months to years. Treatments for Acne Scars A number of treatments are available for acne scars through dermatologic surgery. The type of treatment selected should be the one that is best for you in terms of your type of skin, the cost, what you want the treatment to accomplish, and the possibility that some types of treatment may result in more scarring if you are very susceptible to scar formation. A decision to seek dermatologic surgical treatment for acne scars also depends on * The way you feel about scars. Do acne scars psychologically or emotionally affect your life? Are you willing to \"live with your scars\" and wait for them to fade over time? These are personal decisions only you can make. * The severity of your scars. Is scarring substantially disfiguring, even by objective assessment? * A dermatologist’s expert opinion as to whether scar treatment is justified in your particular case, and what scar treatment will be most effective for you. Before committing to treatment of acne scars, you should have a frank discussion with your dermatologist regarding those questions, and any others you feel are important. You need to tell the dermatologist how you feel about your scars. The dermatologist needs to conduct a full examination and determine whether treatment can, or should, be undertaken. The objective of scar treatment is to give the skin a more acceptable physical appearance. Total restoration of the skin, to the way it looked before you had acne, is often not possible, but scar treatment does usually improve the appearance of your skin. The scar treatments that are currently available include Collagen injection. Collagen, a normal substance of the body, is injected under the skin to \"stretch\" and \"fill out\" certain types of superficial and deep soft scars. Collagen treatment usually does not work as well for ice-pick scars and keloids. Collagen derived from cows or other non-human sources cannot be used in people with autoimmune diseases. Human collagen or fascia is helpful for those allergic to cow-derived collagen. Cosmetic benefit from collagen injection usually lasts 3 to 6 months. Additional collagen injections to maintain the cosmetic benefit are done at additional cost. Autologous fat transfer. Fat is taken from another site on your own body and prepared for injection into your skin. The fat is injected beneath the surface of the skin to elevate depressed scars. This method of autologous (from your own body) fat transfer is usually used to correct deep contour defects caused by scarring from nodulocystic acne. Because the fat is reabsorbed into the skin over a period of 6 to 18 months, the procedure usually must be repeated. Longer lasting results may be achieved with multiple fat-transfer procedures. Dermabrasion. This is thought to be the most effective treatment for acne scars. Under local anesthetic, a high-speed brush or fraise used to remove surface skin and alter the contour of scars. Superficial scars may be removed altogether, and deeper scars may be reduced in depth. Dermabrasion does not work for all kinds of scars; for example, it may make ice-pick scars more noticeable if the scars are wider under the skin than at the surface. In darker-skinned people, dermabrasion may cause changes in pigmentation that require additional treatment. Microdermabrasion. This new technique is a surface form of dermabrasion. Rather than a high-speed brush, microdermabrasion uses aluminum oxide crystals passing through a vacuum tube to remove surface skin. Only the very surface cells of the skin are removed, so no additional wound is created. Multiple procedures are often required but scars may not be significantly improved. Laser Treatment. Lasers of various wavelength and intensity may be used to recontour scar tissue and reduce the redness of skin around healed acne lesions. The type of laser used is determined by the results that the laser treatment aims to accomplish. Tissue may actually be removed with more powerful instruments such as the carbon dioxide laser. In some cases, a single treatment is all that will be necessary to achieve permanent results. Because the skin absorbs powerful bursts of energy from the laser, there may be post-treatment redness for several months. Skin Surgery. Some ice-pick scars may be removed by \"punch\" excision of each individual scar. In this procedure each scar is excised down to the layer of subcutaneous fat; the resulting hole in the skin may be repaired with sutures or with a small skin graft. Subcision is a technique in which a surgical probe is used to lift the scar tissue away from unscarred skin, thus elevating a depressed scar. Skin grafting may be necessary under certain conditions—for example, sometimes dermabrasion unroofs massive and extensive tunnels (also called sinus tracts) caused by inflammatory reaction to sebum and bacteria in sebaceous follicles. Skin grafting may be needed to close the defect of the unroofed sinus tracts. Treatment of keloids. Surgical removal is seldom if ever used to treat keloids. A person whose skin has a tendency to form keloids from acne damage may also form keloids in response to skin surgery. Sometimes keloids are treated by injecting steroid drugs into the skin around the keloid. Topical retinoic acid may be applied directly on the keloid. In some cases the best treatment for keloids in a highly susceptible person is no treatment at all. In summary, acne scars are caused by the body’s inflammatory response to acne lesions. The best way to prevent scars is to treat acne early, and as long as necessary. If scars form, a number of effective treatments are available. Dermatologic surgery treatments should be discussed with a dermatologist. "},{"title":" Acne Scarring - What Are My Treatment Options?

","keywords":" acne scars, acne scarring, adult acne ","article_body":" Acne Scarring can have serious effects on a person's self-image and emotional state.  Fortunately there have been significant advances in the treatment of acne-related scarring in recent years.  It is important to note that nothing will completely heal the majority of scars. Laser Therapy - Using lasers to treat scars is a new technology, but is one of the most promising options for severe scarring.  The lasers remove the scarred skin, and encourage growth of new skin in its place.  After treatment, the skin will be pink and swollen for a week or so.  During this time, bandages need to be kept over the skin to prevent infection.  It takes months for the skin to return to normal, but most people will see less noticeable scars and smoother skin.  Laser scar treatment can be quite expensive, however. Surgical Therapy (Dermabrasion) - This form of scar treatment uses a motorized burr, which usually contains diamond particles.  Diamonds are very strong abrasives when in a powder-form.  A scab will form once the procedure is completed.  Once the wound is healed, a smooth pink layer of new skin will appear.  Multiple treatments are often necessary, and each one can cost $1500. Creams and Gels - There are many topical treatments that claim to reduce the appearance of scars.  Some contain Vitamin E and other nutrients.  Mederma is a popular brand name.  Many people report that it can improve scars in as little as 8 weeks for new scars, or 6 months for older scars.  Results with topical ointments like this will vary from person to person. Collagen Injection - This is a temporary fix, where the patient's own body fat or collagen is injected into the scar site.  This works well for some people with deep-pitted scars.  The material injected serves to raise the skin, and reduce the pitted appearance, and wrinkling from the scar.  However, this procedure needs to be repeated every 6 months and can be expensive. Read more at <a href=\"http//www.adult-acne.org\">www.adult-acne.org</a>.

For most of us, acne is a short-lived annoyance during certain periods of our lives. Unfortunately,  for some people acne is painful long after the pimples have been treated. Scarring from acne is most common for those who have suffered from severe acne, but scarring can affect anyone who has experienced acne. If you are one of the millions of people living with acne scars, there’s good news. There are many options available to diminish these unseemly blemishes. All of these techniques work to restore the normal, healthy appearance of scarred skin; it may not always be possible to get rid of all acne scars, but with the right treatment for you, no one will ever know you were scarred. Acne scar treatments vary in their approaches depending on the severity of your scarring and your budget. You should discuss all of the available options, costs, and side effects with your dermatologist. Before we talk about the treatments available, we should take a look at why acne can cause scarring. The primary reason for any kind of scar is tissue damage. When body tissue is damaged, our body tries to heal and protect it from infection. In the case of acne, dead skin cells block the body’s pores, preventing the secretion of natural oils in the skin. This creates a perfect environment for bacteria to grow, which irritates the skin and causes acne. When acne is aggravated due to harsh scrubbing or other forms of physical attention, it further aggravates the condition and harms the sensitive skin tissue. When the skin finally is able to heal, a scar is left behind. One of the most popular acne scar treatment techniques is injecting collagen under the surface of the scarred skin. Collagen puffs out the skin and evens out the scarred area, making acne less noticeable. Another important acne scar treatment technique is what is called autologous fat transfer. This process makes use of your own body’s fat. Fat is taken from another part of your body and is injected into the affected part, filling up the scar. This technique requires repeated applications because the fat is eventually absorbed into the body, making the scar noticeable once again. Your dermatologist may suggest you try laser treatments or dermabrasion. Both of these techniques are very effective. In the most extreme cases, skin grafting and skin surgery may be considered. Keep in mind that these are only a small number of the options available for acne scar treatment.

As most of them form on the face, it becomes a major cosmetic problem. Those who have acne scars want to get rid of them. But when they meet their doctor and hear about the time, money and pain that will involve procedures such as Chemical peeling, dermabrasion and laser they go into deep thought. Can microdermabrasion performed repeatedly give an answer? Let us find out. Acne scar types- You may develop saucer type scars, or ice pick scars or keloids. With keloids you can do nothing, but with the other two scar types, you can something with microdermabrasion. If you wish to remove the scars at one go, you have to undergo some of the procedures I mentioned above but if you are patient and can wait for the scars to go away slowly and are happy with some improvement, microdermabrasion may help. Microdermabrasion and skin- In microdermabrasion small crystals are thrown at a high velocity and collected back by vacuum. These small crystals abrade the skin surface in a minimal way, removing the dead skin cells and some disfigured spots slowly. With repeated treatments, you may see some improvement in the scars. As new skin keeps forming, the scars may get less conspicuous. You should talk to your doctor about the kind of results you will get painlessly and a little cost from microdermabrasion. As there are two types of procedures- one performed by the doctors with a higher power and other at beauty salons with a lower power, you should find out about which of them is suitable for you. You also get home use machines. Talk to your doctor about all the options and probably you may get your look back at a very little cost and pain. This article is only for informative purposes.

These scars can be easily treated with chemical peeling. Your doctor will assess the depth of the scar and try to remove skin up to that level.

When we get acne many times it resolves without getting infected. This kind of acne leaves hyper pigmentation that fades over a time. When acne becomes infected, it spreads deeper inside and damages the collagen in the dermal layer. As the inflammation increases, more of skin tissues are killed and when the acne gets treated, it leaves a scar, which is normally a deep scar. The depth depends upon the damage done by acne, which depends upon it's severity. Acne scar treatment option- If the scar is deep, you may have to get deep or medium depth chemical peeling done. Laser is another option while dermabrasion is also effective. Your doctor will decide about how to remove such deep scars because some filler may also be needed to fill the scarred skin. If the scar is not deep, you can do superficial peeling with tretinoin  at home. Superficial acne scars and tretinoin- Tretinoin peels the upper layer of the skin. By repeated application, your mild superficial scar will become less prominent. You have the option of using an OTC product or a prescription product. Please consult your doctor about that. Along with treating mild scars tretinoin also removes dead skin cells and removes superficial age lines and spots. This article is only for informative purposes.

Almost no teenager, or adult for that matter, is spared a prolonged period of acne problems. Pubescent girls are generally affected to a more serious degree because of the hormonal upsurges associated with the onset of menstruation. Basically, acne is the result of increased hormonal activity, which causes excess oil production in the skin’s sebaceous glands. Unfortunately, the areas most affected by acne are those which are almost constantly visible with today’s youthful fashion trends. In extreme and far from rare cases, acne can lead to extensive and permanent scarring. Because of the emotional trauma attached to this disorder, it has assumed top priority status among problems that must be avoided at all costs, but this is easier said than done. It has now been proved that oil-saturated foods, chocolate, poor skin hygiene and emotional upset actually play no role in acne occurrence at all, so there go a number of time-honored prevention targets. In fact, the most widely employed means of addressing the problem of acne – camouflaging cosmetics – are actually among the main acne aggravators. Many of them cause subtle skin changes that exacerbate acne occurrence. They can also cause the obstruction of the sebaceous glands, thereby preventing the free drainage of excessive oils. Often, this even applies to some of the so-called acne-prevention compounds. While there is apparently very little an individual can do to prevent acne, there are now effective methods of treating it medically. However, for optimal results, these must necessarily be employed before serious disfigurement can take place. Since these treatments may involve hormone manipulation, they must take place under strict medical supervision.

The cause of acne is hard to determine. However, over secretion of the sebaceous glands is pointed as the cause to trigger most acne outbreaks. Pilosebaceous units are the combination of the hair follicles and oil glands in the skin. Except for the surface of the palms and the soles of the feet, pilosabaceous units are found on the skin tissue throughout the body . They are responsible in secreting the oily substance called sebum. However, due to many factors (e.g. hormonal imbalances, stress and the skin's natural condition) the oil glands may be induced to produce more sebum than normal. When this happens, the excess oil plugs the skin pores. This process brings about bacterial infection and stimulate the reaction of the immune system. In the end, acne inflammation results. Acne can strike at any skin type. An oily skin type is most subseptible to acne. Dry skin on the other hand, may not be as susceptible but serious outbreaks may occur during winter. Normal skin is equally susceptible to acne but the level of severity may not be as high. Presently, acne is not yet totally curable but can be remedied with several acne skin care methods. Many seek the help of topical medications, which are applied on the surface of the skin. However, employing the use of acne skin care products like \"pore strip pads\" may remove whiteheads and blackheads but they would not have any effect on the excess sebum produced. Nevertheless, for remedy and prevention, it is best to employ the following 8 simple tips 1. A healthy, well-balanced diet must be observed. Therefore, your food intake must incorporate all the essential nutrients the body needs for efficient functioning. 2. Drink plenty of fluids like water, juices. Minimize the intake of carbonated drinks. 3. No make up is recommended. 4. Wash your face with mild soap and water. The logic is to not remove the dirt (as the majority of acne-inflicted person perceive) but to remove the plugs on the skin pores, which may be a combination of dead skin cells, bacteria and hardened sebum. Although dirt is not truly the cause of acne, it may contribute to further infection through its interaction with skin debris and particles and extra oil in the skin. 5. Use topical cleansing pads that may contain one or the combination of the following salicylic acid, sulfur and benzoyl peroxide to remove excess oil. Another way to minimize the presence of extra oil in the skin is to wash the face with the hottest water you can withstand. 6. Minimize the use of harsh cleansers and use acne skin care items that exfoliate mildly. Do not scrub vigorously to the affected areas. 7. If your hands are dirty, refrain from touching your face. 8. If you have long hair, tie up your hair so that it is kept away from the face. This is especially so if the weather is hot and you have been perspiring. Preventative acne skin care steps are just as important as the treatment of acne itself. With prevention, at least, you know how to ensure that your acne problem does not escalate and spread to a bigger infected area.

Here’s a summary for you and some real honest to goodness solutions. It worked for me and it will work for you too. What is Acne? Acne is a disorder resulting from the action of hormones on the skin's oil glands (sebaceous glands), which leads to plugged pores and outbreaks of lesions commonly called pimples or zits. Acne lesions usually occur on the face, neck, back, chest, and shoulders. Although heredity may be a cause of this problem, it is more associated with hormonal levels and how you care for your skin (e.g. rubbing your skin too much will cause it). Chocolate and greasy foods are often blamed, but foods seem to have little effect on the development and course of acne in most people. In addition, dirty skin does not cause acne and neither does stress. How Is Acne Treated? You can buy over the counter medicine (OTC), see your family doctor, or a dermatologist (skin doctor). Over-the-counter(OTC) Medicines Benzoyl peroxide, resorcinol, salicylic acid, and sulfur are the most common topical OTC medicines used to treat acne. Topical OTC medications are available in many forms, such as gel, lotion, cream, soap, or pad. Prescription Topical Medicines Several types of prescription topical medicines include benzoyl peroxide, tretinoin, adapalene, and azelaic acid. Some people develop side effects from using prescription topical medicines including stinging, burning, redness, peeling, scaling, or discoloration of the skin. Prescription Oral Medicines Oral antibiotics are thought to help control acne by curbing the growth of bacteria and reducing inflammation. Examples are clindamycin, erythromycin, sulfur, or isotretinoin. Some people experience side effects when taking these antibiotics, such as an increased tendency to sunburn, upset stomach, dizziness or lightheadedness, changes in skin color, and dry skin. Other treatments There are lazer treatments for rare serious cases and there are safe and natural herbal medications that work like over the counter medications, but often with less side effects. How Should People With Acne Care for Their Skin? * Clean Skin Gently with a mild cleanser 3 or 4 times a day. * Avoid Frequent Handling of the Skin. * Shave Carefully. * Avoid a Sunburn or Suntan. * Use Non-Oily Cosmetics. In summary, there are many treatments out there for acne skin problems. Talk to your doctor if you’re unsure what to do. Try some of the suggestions mentioned here.

Unknowingly, many people tend to use acne skin care methods that aggravate their present condition further. Take for example the notion that a patient must seriously scrub his face to take away dirt. Is this the correct way for acne skin care? Not quite. Here's the scoop. First, it is important to understand the cause of acne before knowing what acne skin care measures to use. Acne is neither a direct resul of dirt or uncleanness. However, your acne problems worsen when dirt mixes with sebum and other skin debris to create a mixture which may settle in the pus of the pustules. Medically speaking, acne is caused by many internal body factors such as a weak immune and digestive system, impaired internal detoxification system, and stress. Outside influences like weather elements, pollutants, humidity and the bacteria thriving on the human skin contribute to aggravate your acne. Ultimately, all these factors may not have effectively produced acne if it were not for the \"P acnes\", which digest excess sebum. The effect results in inflammation, swelling and pain. It is not easy to pin point the cause of acne on your own. It is best to solicit the help of a dermatologist to help you determine the cause of your acne and to recommend an appropriate acne treatment. Notwithstanding, there are a couple of tips on proper acne skin care that you should be aware of. The first step to good acne skin care is to minimize the sebum production to a level to sustain normal skin. However, in most cases, to treat acne, more needs to be done. If skin oiliness persist, it is best to keep the pores open. The principle behind this acne care is to release the clogs in the pores and wash them out. The only way to achieve this is to wash the face with extremely hot water. Repeat this procedure to help repel skin bacteria. It is also recommended that you do not zealously wash your face with harsh scrubs or cleansers. By doing this, you may only aggravate the severity of your acne. Actually, washing your face gently two times a day is enough. In terms of acne skin care products, choose the ones that work best best for you. Select the acne care product that gently clears away the oil and dirt without leaving your skin dry and irritated. In fact, ,mild acne care works best for all skin types. This will require some trials and consequently, some errors. It is best to trust your dermatologist recommendation first. If his recommended product does not work, then shift to other acne skin care products. This way, you are experimenting with acne care products that may suit you best. It is important to note that during your first applications, use small amounts on a small area so that any damage is at best limited. Also, avoid alcohol-based cleansers as these may only dry out your skin. Dry skin is more vulnerable to serious acne outbreaks. On the other hand, minimize the use of oil-based products as these in themselves may add up to the pre-existing oil content of the skin. At any rate, an acne patient must avoid applying cosmetics, however oil-free they may appear to be. Proper acne skin care methods can go a long way to help you in your acne problems. Good diet and lifestyle habits are other measures that you can also adopt for better glowing skin. Good luck!

Others will employ the use of therapeutic light (or photodynamic) therapy. All of them will include hygiene and exercise in their program, and quite a few even offer acne surgery where extensive scarring has taken place.

Medical experts at these centers will also emphasize proper liver function, dietary adjustments, soundness of the digestive system and overall internal health. Depending on the orientation of its treatment program, the center will employ either pharmacological, homeopathic or organic (natural) treatment modules or subtle combinations of all of them.

Often, a person who has acne cannot control its occurrence. But, by following a few acne skin care practices, acne can be controlled and even gotten rid of. Acne is an inflammatory skin disease that affects millions of individuals. The most universal type of acne is known as \"common acne\". Acne is caused when too many oils are secreted from the glands and those oils mix with dead skin cells, blocking the hair follicles. More oil secretions increase underneath the already blocked follicles (or pores), and skin bacteria begin to grow rapidly. This leads to red and irritated skin that most often appears as bumps on the skin's surface. Any skin surface of the body is susceptible to acne, but it most commonly (and heavily) appears on the face, chest, back, and upper arm region. Acne commonly begins to occur during puberty due to an irregular response by the body to regular levels of testosterone, a male hormone. Often, acne begins to subside or disappear altogether by the mid 20's. However, some individuals do suffer with it throughout adulthood. And some adults do not even see the onset of acne until well into the adult years. This is known as adult onset acne. Acne can leave scarring on the skin, as well as have a scarring effect on a person's self-esteem, and even lead to depression. Because society can be so unforgiving about appearances, there are various medically prescribed treatments available, as well as acne skin care regimens that can be utilized in order to minimize the symptoms of acne. Different things cause acne for different sufferers. A few of the recognized causes of acne include heredity, hormonal activity (puberty, menstruation, pregnancy), stress, certain medications, and skin irritation. All of these things have the potential to cause acne, as well as exacerbate it. There are a few myths regarding acne. For instance we've all heard of a mom telling her child not to eat too many greasy foods like French fries, or eat too many sweets, because it will give him or her pimples. That is simply an old wives' tale. Diet does not cause acne, and does not affect it. Also, poor hygiene has no bearing on the occurrence of acne. Acne is not caused by dirt, and having poor hygiene habits will not aggravate the condition. There are many treatments for acne available, both through prescription, and over the counter. There are antibiotics in the form of pills, as well as topical creams that are designed to treat the condition. Exfoliation can be used as a treatment to remove and prevent the build up of dead skin cells. And light therapy is being used more and more to treat acne. It is important to consult a dermatologist in order to determine the best course of treatment and learn the best regimen of acne skin care to carry out. Dealing with the occurrence of acne requires knowing how to properly care for the skin. Acne skin care can help keep the problem from getting worse, and even alleviate it. It is important to gently wash the skin at least twice a day with a gentle skin cleanser. Do not scrub with a rough pad or use a rough soap. This will make the acne problem worse. And always completely rinse the skin after cleansing. As part of an acne skin care routine, it is important to remember not to touch the afflicted skin areas. Do not try to squeeze acne. An infection could occur, compounding the problem, and scarring could result. Also, avoid the sun when possible. Wear protective clothing to avoid tanning or burning. The skin will age faster, and any fading effect of the acne is temporary and will become visible again when the burn or tan fades. When using cosmetics, take care to use oil-free products, and products that are non-comedogenic (won't clog the pores). And for men who shave their faces, it is important to shave very carefully. Shave with a light hand to avoid cutting or nicking the blemishes. If these steps in acne skin care are taken, the pain and embarrassment of the problem can be alleviated, and over time, eliminated completely.

People who prick pimples and blemishes as if pricking a bubble only aggravates the risk of skin inflammation and acne scars. Avoid hand contact with your face for better acne skin care results. For men, shaving should be done with care. Choose the best electric shavers and safety razors you can trust for years. They'll be more comfortable to use. Men need not use a super sharp blade to get rid of that beard. A regular shaver used with soap and water, or shaving cream will help you get that smooth finish. Doctors advised men to shave lightly, and shave only when necessary for acne skin care maintenance. Products for daily skin care regime 1 Glycerin is a good moisturizer. Glycerin is known to moisturize from the inside out, pulling in moisture from the outside environment. It's typically found in better quality, more expensive soaps like a hand made soap or good cleanser. Lower grade, commercially produced soaps usually remove the glycerin and use more cost effective chemicals which are much more destructive to the skin. 2 Tea Tree Oil and Eucalyptus are terrific for cleansing. Tea tree oil is considered to have some of the best natural antiseptic / antifungal properties in the world. Eucalyptus oil has been shown to fight infection-causing bacteria, fungi, and viruses very effectively. 3 Pure Aloe Vera - the absolute best moisturizer. Always remember what is best for your body is best for your skin, especially since your skin is the largest organ of your body. So remember to watch your diet and consume healthy vitamins, minerals and other supplements. This will help to prevent and help conquer acne breakout.

You may be thinking about the many convenient over-the-counter methods for treating your acne. You are not alone. As a go-to solution, most people who are acne sufferers will just go to their local pharmacy and buy medication over-the-counter, based on whatever knowledge or information that they get. It could be recommendations from family members and friends, it could be that impressive sales copy from a magazine, it could be that television ad. However, it is highly advisable to seek consultation with a qualified doctor before you get your hands on any kind of over-the-counter products. The doctor is able to give you his professional opinion on the best and most suitable course of acne skin care treatment for your case. You can find large numbers of acne skin care treatment products hitting the shelves regularly, and so deciding on which is the best product can be a daunting task. You may be influenced by your friends. But what worked for your friends, may not necessarily work well on you. Your friends may have different levels of complexity of the acne condition, so it is really difficult to judge. The best way is to do your own research on the active ingredients in various acne skin care treatment medications. Here, I have outlined two of the most popular ingredients in acne treatments. Benzoyl Peroxide This is one of the most popular active ingredients in acne treatment medications. Found in ointments and gels, the benzoyl peroxide does it’s job by fighting the bacteria which causes your acne. Not only that, it will also remove dead skin cells that collect on the surface of your skin. What has it got to do with skin cell? Well, it is these dead skin cells which, when combined with sebum, create the unsightly blackheads, whiteheads, and pimples. Benzoyl peroxide has so far been proven to be safe and effective. It can also be used as an after-care solution to keep your skin free from the bacteria that causes acne. But like all the other ingredients out there, benzoyl peroxide does have one side effect. Prolonged usage of this ingredient will lead to dry skin. However, this can be prevented by slowly decreasing the frequency of the benzoyl peroxide that is applied to your skin. Salicylic Acid Besides the benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid is another popular ingredient used in acne treatment medications. What this acid does is to mainly clear up the dead skin cells which may accumulate too quickly, clogging up the pores as a result. The salicylic acid should continue to be used even after your skin is cleared of acne, to prevent any future outbreaks. Like benzoyl peroxide, the salicylic acid will cause you to have dry and irritated skin. It is safe to say that the benzoyl peroxide is the most versatile among all the other ingredients for the battle against acne. It can be used in cleansing liquids, lotion, cream and gels which can be applied directly onto your skin. The creams and lotions can be applied onto the affected areas as and when required, while the cleansing medications are usually applied once or twice a day. Just a word of caution  avoid getting the benzoyl peroxide into contact with your eyes, mouth or nose, as it will cause inflammation and some irritation.

The idea here is to consult a skin specialist, also known as a dermatologist, who can give you valuable information, advice and tips on how to treat your acne. If your acne condition is only moderate and not serious, then you can go for the over-the-counter type of medications. But please do seek the help of a dermatologist if your acne has reached a severe state, where he will recommend some prescription medications. However, it is still advisable to go for the prescription method even if your acne is mild, because the prescription method tends to be much more effective than what over-the-counter method can offer. There are basically two types of prescription acne skin care treatments, namely antibiotics and ointments. Antibiotics are the common agent used to combat acne, and they can be used as a type of lotion, or taken orally. Ointment prescriptions include ingredients such as zinc or retinoid. Antibiotics Tetracycline is the most common antibiotic used to treat your acne condition. What the tetracycline does is kill the bacteria which causes the acne, and it also helps to reduce any inflammation which may result from the acne. One thing you should know about antibiotic treatment is that it may take up to a few weeks or even months to see the effect. Not only that, you must continue the antibiotic treatment even after your acne has subsided. Just like any other medications out there, the tetracycline antibiotic does have side effects. It will increase your skin’s overall sensitivity to sun light, which will lead to severe sun burns if you stay under the sun for a prolonged period. Other possible side effects include dizziness and stomach upset. Ointments Antibiotic ointments generally have lesser complications as compared to oral antibiotics. They are highly useful when it comes to killing the bacteria which caused your acne. When the ointments are used in conjunction with other treatments like benzoyl peroxide, the bacteria may not develop resistance to the antibiotics. Retinoid Derived from vitamin A, retinoid can be applied directly onto the skin in the form of creams or lotions. Retinoid medications are particularly useful for treating blackheads and whiteheads by opening up clogged pores. The one common side effect of retinoid is that you will experience dry skin. If your acne condition is so severe that it doesn’t respond to either antibiotics or ointments, then oral retinoid can be your next option. What an oral retinoid does is to cause the upper most layer of your skin to peel off, and in the process opens up more pores. Oral retinoid can also restrict the body from producing excess sebum, the oily substance which is responsible for your oily skin. Oral retinoids must be used with caution, because there are known serious side effects and complications that comes with this type of retinoid. They can cause birth defects if a woman takes them during pregnancy. Other complications include depression and liver damage. So if an acne sufferer is on oral retinoid treatment, then regular medical attention and follow-up is required to make sure that the side effects and complications are reduced to the minimum. If you are not sure of the reliability of over-the-counter medications, then always seek the advice of your dermatologist who can give you reliable prescription medication, and other advice for the most effective acne skin care treatment for your particular condition.

People with acne should take special care for their skin. In many situations, a gentle acne skin treatment is enough to get rid of this annoying problem. A proper everyday care when your acne is still light or moderate can give you the healthy skin you want and prevent severe acne from developing. All you have to do is follow a few guidelines in your daily skin care process. Gently Wash Skin Washing your skin is the most important part of an acne skin treatment. Wash your skin twice a day with a mild cleanser, once in the morning and once in the evening. You should also wash your skin after heavy exercise, when you've been sweating a lot. Some people try to cure their acne and reduce oil production using aggressive detergent soaps and scrub pads. However, instead of improving the situation, scrubbing your skin will only make things worse. You can ask a dermatologist for advice on the type of cleanser your should use. Thoroughly rinse your skin after you wash it. Astringents are only recommended if your skin is very oily, and only on oil spots. Doctors also advise patients to shampoo their hair on a regular basis. People with oily hair should shampoo it daily. Acne and Shaving Guys who have or have had acne in the past should shave carefully. Test both electric and safety razors to decide which is more comfortable for you. If you decide on a safety razor, always use a sharp blade. Soften your beard with soap and water before applying the shaving cream. You can avoid nicking blemishes by shaving lightly and not more often than necessary. Avoid Handling Your Skin Frequently Avoiding aggressive behavior upon your skin is also an important part of the acne skin treatment. If you try to squeeze or pop your pimples, you risk forming unsightly scars. You should even avoid touching or rubbing your acne lesions. Do not try to pop your pimples either, because you might get scars or spread acne. Avoid Excessive Exposure to Sunlight Some of the medications that are used to treat acne can make you more likely to sunburn. Even though a red or tanned skin may make lesions less visible, these are only temporary improvements. Long-term effects are generally negative. Excessive sun exposure involves many risks, such as faster skin aging and developing skin cancer. Makeup The makeup you choose to use is also a part of the overall acne skin treatment. While you are being treated for acne, you might need to change some of the makeup products you are using. Use only oil-free cosmetics. Read the label if you are not sure. During the first couple of treatments, it might be difficult to apply foundation. You should also avoid oily hair products, that may cause closed comedones on the forehead. Use only cosmetics that are labeled as non-comedogenic. Even those can cause acne in some people, so you should be very careful.

Of course, remember that what works for someone else may not always work for you. Everyone's skin is different in the first place and the cause of acne may not also be the same. You can always start off by using over the counter medications to treat your acne. If your skin is sensitive or prone to drying, use a mild cleanser or soap. You may have to experiment with different cleansers in order to find one that does not irritate or exacerbate your acne. Wash your face once or twice daily but do not scrub or rub excessively. Avoid touching your face as your hands may have a lot of bacteria. Also if you find that a certain food may be contributing to your acne, stop consuming the food and see what happens. When using make-up, read the labels and purchase products labeled non-acnegenic, non-comedogenic, and hypoallergenic. These products are formulated so as not to irritate even the most sensitive skin. Avoid sharing make-up with others, and always use clean washcloths, towels, and make-up sponges or other instruments to avoid transferring germs to your face. If you're interested in creating acne skin treatment from kitchen ingredients, you are not alone. Many recipes have been in use for many years. Again, everyone reacts differently to the same treatment, but these home remedies are useful for those who are suffering from mild acne. The following are three recipes that you can easily follow. Baking soda scrub Making a baking soda scrub is easy to use, and many have reported successful results from its use. This scrub is designed to exfoliate your skin. Exfoliation is key in treating acne; since it focuses on removing dead skin cells that can get trapped in your pores and then manifest themselves as acne. First, mix a small amount of baking soda (a teaspoon will probably be enough) with water to create a consistent paste. Very gently, massage the baking soda scrub onto your skin. Leave it on for approximately one minute, then rinse clean with lukewarm review. Use a clean towel to pat your face dry. Another popular home treatment uses apple cider vinegar. Apple cider vinegar has long been lauded for its health benefits, including acne. Some claim that apple cider vinegar has the ability to rid your skin of bacteria, balance your skin's pH level, and keep your face fresh and free of excessive oil. Apple cider vinegar is also high in citric acid, which is a strong exfoliating ingredient that can help remove excess dead skin cells and improve your skin's overall texture and tone. To use, simply dilute the apple cider vinegar, one part vinegar to eight parts water. If possible, use high quality apple cider vinegar and purified water. To use, wet a cotton ball with your apple cider vinegar mix and gently moisten your skin. Don't overdo it. Apple cider vinegar is strong stuff that can dry out your skin, resulting in even more breakouts. Egg whites, rich in protein and vitamins, have also been a favorite healing ingredient. Egg whites have long been used to help tone and tighten skin. Simply beat two egg whites together to a consistent froth. Apply the mixture to your face and let sit for about fifteen minutes. Rinse the egg off with lukewarm water. Of course, it is always best to treat your acne while it is still mild. Still, if your efforts to clear up your skin using over the counter medications do not seem to work and your acne is getting out of control, make an appointment to visit a dermatologist. Your dermatologist is likely to prescribe you with anti-acne oral or topical agents. "},{"title":" Acne Solutions ","word_count":484,"summary":" Proper solutions to people who have acnes. ","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" A great deal of money is spent by people trying to find acne solutions that work. Unfortunately, many never find the right acne solution, and their acne either clears up on it's own, or they learn to live with it. You can, however, find an acne solution that will work for you, without spending hundreds or thousands of dollars looking for the cure, by following these simple steps. 1. Make sure that you are washing your face two or three times each day, with clean water and a pure soap, such as Ivory. 2. Try applying essential oils directly to the acne. Oils to try are Tea Tree Oil, Bergamot Oil, Clove Oil, Lavender Oil, and Rosewood Oil. If you have sensitive skin, you may need to dilute the oil with Grapeseed oil to avoid irritation. Apply the oil before going to bed, then wash it away, using pure soap and clean water, in the morning. Give it about a month to see if it is working. This is one of the least expensive acne solutions that has proven to be effective for many people. 3. If the essential oil doesn't work for you, try a good over the counter product, such as ProActiv. It is expensive, but you will spend less money using a product that has been proven to work, than you will buying creams and acne solutions that do not work. Bypass the junk, and go with what has a better chance of working. 4. If ProActiv doesn't work for you, visit an allergist to see if you have any food allergies. Often food allergies will cause acne, and the best acne solution in this case is to eliminate those foods from your diet completely. If a food allergy is causing the acne, not other acne solution should be needed. 5. If there are no food allergies, or eliminating foods did not work, it is time to see a dermatologist. The doctor may prescribe Accutane, which is also expensive. It is taken orally, and may cause side effects, but it has been proven to be quite beneficial in the treatment of acne. 6. If Accutane does not work, talk to your dermatologist about trying Retin-a. Retin-a is used to treat acne, acne scars, wrinkles, skin discolorations, and other scars and skin problems. It is very effective as an acne solution. The key is to make sure that you give the acne treatments time to work. Give each step at least one month, and possibly more. Some acne treatments will actually make the acne appear to be worse before it starts clearing up. This is perfectly normal, and in most cases, even to be expected. Don't waste money on cheap acne treatments that don't work. If it worked - it wouldn't be cheap. The cheapest acne solution that has been proven to work is essential oils. Everything that really works after that is expensive, but well worth the price. "},{"title":" Acne Talk For Teenagers ","word_count":483,"summary":" Acne is painful - on the inside.

The fact is that approximately 85% of the population in the United States has at some point suffered with acne, and approximately 17 million people have acne. You are far from alone. Acne in teenagers is caused by the action of hormones on the skin's oil glands. During puberty both boys and girls have an increase in the hormones called androgens. These hormones cause sebaceous glands under the surface of the skin to enlarge. The sebaceous glands in response produce excess oil. This excess oil mixes with bacteria and dead skin on the skin's surface and blocks pores. Inside these pores the bacteria multiple and cause inflammation. Acne is usually genetic, so you may not be able to avoid it. However there are things you should know, an things you can do to help you deal with it. There are many myths surrounding acne. The most well known one is that chocolate and greasy foods cause breakouts. Over the years dermatologists have discovered there is no evidence of this claim. However, if you find you do break out more after eating certain foods, avoid them. Although it may not have an affect on your acne, eating a healthy diet complete with fruits and vegetables is a good idea. Another myth is that acne is caused by poor hygiene. This is not true at all. As mentioned above acne is caused by overproduction of oil, period. Myth three advises you to scrub your face several times a day. Actually, over washing your skin can cause it to become more inflamed. Also, if you use drying products to excess on you skin your skin may rebel by producing more oil. Whatever one of the literally hundreds of treatments you decide to choose remember that acne takes time to disappear. Overnight or miraculous results don't happen. It takes six to eight weeks to see results from treatment. Once acne has cleared continued treatment will needed to prevent it from recurring. If an acne treatment takes more than six to eight weeks to show a significant difference it probably won't work. Try something else. You really should see the advice of a dermatologist. With the number of products on the market, how do you choose? What might clear one person's acne might not clear anothers. Your skin type and lesion types must be taken into consideration. Before you spend a bundle of money on an unknown treatment see a dermatologist. He or she can plan an individualized program based on your skin's needs.

","keywords":" acne treatment, acne skin treatment, acne care treatment ","article_body":" Acne is a skin condition which is characterized by pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads. It is the most common of all skin disorders and is most often found on the face, neck, back, and chest.  Almost everyone will develop acne, to some degree. Most people will get mild cases, some moderate, and a few people will get severe cases. Teens are not the only ones to get it. It generally affects those between the ages of 12 and 44. Acne often starts at the onset of puberty, when the body increases its production of androgens, which are the male sex hormones. These hormones stimulate of sebum which is an oily skin lubricant. It this sebum is secreted faster than it can pass through the skin pores, a blemish develops. Most people get acne on their face, back, or chest, but it can also appear on other parts of the body, including the arms and thighs. Factors that may contribute to acne include diet, hormonal imbalance, heredity, oily skin, menstrual cycles, stress, allergies, and the use of certain kinds of drugs. Along with the obvious physical symptoms of acne, there can be an emotional impact as well. One can experience embarrassment and anxiety about their appearance. This may lead to social withdrawal, depression, and mood changes. In acne treatment, there is a difference between skin care and acne cure. Using astringent lotions, pads that remove oil, and medicated bar soaps can help keep the skin clean, but will probably not prevent you from having further acne problems.  Prescription medications and lotions may help, but will most likely not cure you of acne. To actually cure acne, one needs to get to the core of the acne problem, not just mask its symptoms. The largest organ of the body is the skin. One function is to help eliminate toxins from the body by sweating. When the liver and kidneys are unable to fully discharge body toxins, the skin then begins to help out. As toxins are released from the body via the skin, acne may be triggered. It is important to keep the skin’s pores clean and open, but acne may still result. Curing your acne by natural treatment involves cleansing the skin from the inside. Balancing the natural testosterone and estrogen found in the male and female body gets to the source of the problem. When there is excess estrogen and excess testosterone, as is common in the teenage years, acne may result. Therefore, achieving hormonal balance will cure acne naturally, and have a longer-lasting effect. External acne treatments normally mask the symptoms and are more short term. Following a natural acne treatment plan that involves balancing your hormones allows your body to heal itself from the inside and is more effective in the long run.

This acne treatment drug is available in non-prescription form for concentrations of 2.5%, 5% and 10%. If you are looking for concentrations higher than 10%, you need a doctor's prescription. Several studies have shown that 2.5% benzoyl peroxide is equally effective to combat pimples and is less irritating. Therefore, if you want to try Benzoyl Peroxide to treat your acne, you should begin with a low concentration (example 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide). <b>How Benzoyl Peroxide works</b> Before we go into details on how benzoyl peroxide can prevent acne, it is useful to understand how acne is formed. Propionibacterium acnes (P.acnes) is a bacteria that causes the skin disorder acne. P.acnes is a major inhabitant of human skin and is the causative agent of acne. This skin-dwelling organism will multiply rapidly within clogged sebaceous follicles if left untreated. Fortunately, these bacteria cannot live in the presence of oxygen. Benzoyl Peroxide is an oxygen-releasing chemical in the organic peroxide family. Upon applying on the affected area, this chemical is absorbed into the pores and releases the oxygen to destroy P.acnes. <b>Side Effects of Benzoyl Peroxide</b> It is important to note that there are some side effects when using this anti-acne medication a.  Dryness If you are using 5% or 10% of benzoyl peroxide, you may want to try a lower concentration, say 2.5% of benzoyl peroxide. b.  Irritation For irritation, you can reduce the usage frequency. If you encounter severe irritation even the usage frequency is low, you should discontinue using the product. c.  Allergy If you are allergic to Benzoyl Peroxide, you should discontinue using it and consult your dermatologist for other acne treatments. d.  Bleach Benzoyl Peroxide is a powerful bleaching agent. You should prevent your hair from contacting this bleaching agent as this medicine can cause permanent color dampening. Before using Benzoyl Peroxide for your acne treatment, please take note that this medicine generates free radicals in the skin. The result is redness of the skin due to oxidative stress. The effect is similar to unprotected sun exposure. If you are using a benzoyl peroxide product to treat your acne, you should avoid unnecessary sun exposure and use a sunscreen during the day.

These red bumps get filledl with a nasty puss caused by the body fighting the infection of the bacteria. What can you do? Well, there are a number of things that you can do to fight the bacteria for acne treatment. Treatments that kill the bacteria that cause acne included the use of antibiotics like tetracycline, doxycycline and minocyclne. These are to be taken orally. Also topical antibiotics or bactericides like Benzoyl peroxide or erythromycin can help. The bacteria also known as “P. acnes”, does however become resistant to the antibiotics eventually. However Benzoyl peroxide, an oxidizer, does not seem to generate resistance by the bacteria. While the acne will come back, it is a short term and temporary cure and is applied topically. Gently exfoliating the skin can also help. This method can be done by using a cloth or a liquid scrub, or by using certain chemicals. Chemical exfoliating substances include salicylic acid and glycolic acid. Both of these agents cause a peeling of the top layer of skin, which prevents a build up of dead skin. Another over the counter acne treatment is salicylic acid, which softens skin and gets rid of dead skin cells, which in turn unclogs pores. Many face wash products contain this ingredient. Also sulfur contained in many over the counter products works well for many people. Another product is glycolic acid, which is found in anti-aging products as well as acne medicines. However, natural health practitioners prefer to recommend the use of natural acne treatment. Tea tree oil is gaining in popularity. It kills the bacteria and also reduces redness and inflammation. It works much the same as Benzoyl peroxide but causes less skin irritation. Tee trea oil can be easily found at health food stories. Acupuncture is used by some and is thought to alleviate hormonal imbalances in the body. Those who use acupuncture also usually suggest lifestyle changes and a change in diet, including cutting back on dairy products. Light therapy is another natural remedy to fight the bacteria that has many adherents. Many people believe that the bacteria that causes acne insensitive to light in the blue wavelength of the light spectrum. Light therapy means shining blue light onto a patient for fifteen minutes at a time twice a week, usually for four weeks. This treatment can be expenses, running about $150 per treatment. Not all patients have had good results, but some have. Also since light in this wavelength is not harmful to the skin, there are no side effects or after effects. Some people think that acne is caused by poor hygiene and by eating certain foods. There is no scientific evidence linking diet to acne. But a good diet sure will not hurt in skin repair and damaged tissues. Good personal hygiene also goes a long way in your acne treatment.

","keywords":" ","article_body":" Before we discuss the topical treatments for acne we have to note down the effects we desire from those treatments. The desired results in acne treatment are- reduce inflammation, open the closed pores, kill the bacteria and reduce the oil. To get these results the following topical treatments are generally used- Benzoyl Peroxide-The most common medicine that has been used since long to treat acne has been benzoyl peroxide. Benzoyl peroxide performs three main functions - it removes excess oil, unclogs the closed pores and kills the bacteria. Benzoyl Peroxide is available in form of cream or gel and can cause excessive dryness because it removes oil, can some times also cause redness and some swelling. Because of these possible side effects do not use more than recommended dose of benzoyl peroxide. Salicylic Acid-This is commonly used to treat non-inflammatory acne. Salicylic acid corrects the abnormal shedding of skin cells that block the pore openings. Salicylic Acid does not kill the bacteria nor reduces the sebum production. It helps unclog the pores. It can be effectively used to treat whiteheads and blackheads. Sulfur and Resorcinol- they are commonly used in combination and help unclog the blocked pores and reduce excess oil. This combination can treat white heads and blackheads. It may also cause peeling of skin and redness. Alcohol and Acetone -Alcohol is a mild antimicrobial agent and acetone is a solvent that cleanses dirt and oil. This combination can be used to treat mild form of acne. Azelaic Acid -azelaic acid reduces the bacteria P.acnes and helps reduce the abnormal shedding of dead skin cells. It reduces inflammation by these two actions. Azelaic acid is used to treat mild and moderate acne. Azelaic acid can produce some dryness and lighten the skin where it is applied. Otherwise it is well tolerated by most people. Topical Antibiotics- antibiotics such as Clindamycin, Erythromycin and Sodium sulfacetamide are used to reduce the population of inflammation causing bacteria P.acnes. Prolonged use of Antibiotics can produce resistance in the body. It is important to use antibiotics as directed by your doctor. Most of the topical antibiotics do not have any side effects except dryness or irritation. You should report these to your doctor. Topical Retinoids- retinoids are Vitamin A derivatives and are very effective in treatment of mild to moderate acne. Topical retinoid formulations may contain active ingrdients such as Adapalene, Tazarotene and Tretinoin. Topical retinoids clear the clogged pores and have anti-inflammatory properties. Another advantage of using topical retinoids is that they help remove fine lines and wrinkles. Topical retinoids may produce skin irritation. They should be strictly used under medical supervision as some of them such as Tazarotene have shown birth defects in animal trials. This article is only for informative purposes.

","keywords":" acne, acne control, acne treatment, acne medicine ","article_body":" While it is true that in most cases acne can be safely and effectively treated with over the counter treatments any time you have an unusual skin condition it is advisable to consult a dermatologist. The doctor can provide you with valuable advice on treating the condition even if it is only acne. Severe acne should always be treated by a dermatologist, they can provide prescription medication that is effective at treating the more sever acne outbreaks. Moderate and mild acne can usually be treated without the advice of a doctor but even with moderate acne prescription medications may be able to treat it better and faster then over the counter solutions. Medications for treating acne are given in one of two forms; oral or topical. In many cases the doctor will use a combination of both types to treat the outbreak. Antibiotics are frequently used to treat acne and can be provided in either form. Other topical medications will usually include ingredients such as zinc and retinoids. The most common antibiotic for treating acne is tetracycline. It works with a dual action both killing the acne causing bacteria as well as helping to reduce the inflammation. Antibiotics are not an immediate fix and will usually have to be taken for weeks or even months before the acne clears up, you will also have to continue the antibiotic even after the acne clears up to prevent a re-occurrence. There are some side effect reported with the use of tetracycline, with extreme sensitivity to the sun being the most common one. Any one taking tetracycline needs to be very careful about exposure to sunlight to avoid severe sunburns. Some people may also experience nausea, hives and even dizziness. Women undergoing treatment with tetracycline may notice an increase in vaginal yeast infections. Young children and pregnant women cannot take tetracycline because it can cause discoloration of growing teeth. Ointments that contain antibiotics have a lower rate of reported side effects. These ointments will kill the bacteria and but there can be some cases of the bacteria becoming resistant to the antibiotics. Combining other medications such as; benzoyl peroxide with the antibiotic lotion can greatly reduce the chance of such problems. Retinoids are a derivative of vitamin A and are usually applied directly the skin in the form of a lotion or crème. The use of topical retinoid medications is very effective in treating blackheads and whiteheads. It produces the positive results by cleaning out the pores that cause the acne; the only common side affect is dry skin. If the acne is severe and is not responding to other treatments then an oral retinoid medication may be used. This will cause the top layer of skin to peel off which will also open the pores. The oral retinoids also cause the body to create less sebum, which also reduces the acne issues by reducing the oil on the skin. There can be some rather serious side effects associated with using oral retinoid medications. Since they can cause serious birth defects any woman on oral retinoids should use two forms of birth control to avoid the possibility of pregnancy. They can also cause depression and liver damage so anyone using these medications must be closely monitored by their doctor. There are some other medications that have the side effect of helping with acne. In some women birth control pills help reduce acne by changing the hormone levels and reducing the testosterone levels. Zinc can also be used to treat acne.

This prevents cysts from further growth and scar formation is reduced. Steroid Injection- Sometimes cysts are injected to dry them out with steroid. This gives quick results. Peeling and dermabrasion- with mild chemical peeling and microdermabrasion, the epidermis is cleaned of dead skin cells, the pores are opened and acne is reduced.

Pizza, chocolate, coke or any other junk food has never been proven to cause this. That does not mean to say you should carry on eating all this junk food. A sensible diet is good for everyone, and helps you feel better. 2) Acne is caused by dirt. Wrong!  Actually washing your face more than twice a day or scrubbing your face, with pads or flannels will make it worse. Acne treatment needs mild gentle soap and to rinse thoroughly. 3) Sweat will clear my pores. Wrong! A mixture of body sweat and oils can aggravate certain situations for some acne sufferers. Shower immediately after any sport and wear loose clothing. 4) Women’s Make-up can cause Acne. Wrong!  No scientific evidence has been found to verify this. Most products today are mad to stop the clogging of the pores. So this is not the problem. Do not wear make-up though when exercising as this can irritate the problem. 5) Stress Causes Acne. Wrong! To an extent. Stress can trigger off some hormones, which could aggravate the situation. But it is not the cause. 6) You Cannot Cure Acne. But you can treat it! There are a lot of good acne treatments on the market. See your doctor. 7) Sun can help. Wrong! It can in time worsen the situation in time.

Also it is always a good idea to follow the dermatologist’s advice, there is no point in trying remedies at home and ending up treating complications due to the home remedies. Let nature run its own course, most acne cases usually settle down over a period of time and treatment can only accelerate the process but there is no substitute for Mother Nature when it comes to healing. How should people go about acne skin care? This article enumerates some basic guidelines to go by. For example, you should clean your skin gently, avoid frequent handling of the skin, avoid sun tanning, and lastly, women should choose their cosmetics carefully and men must shave carefully for good acne skin care. People with acne may try to stop outbreaks and oil production by scrubbing their skin and using strong detergent soaps. However, scrubbing will not help acne skin care; in fact, it can make the problem worse. Most doctors recommend that people with acne gently wash their skin with a mild cleanser for acne skin care, once in the morning and once in the evening. Patients should ask their doctor or another health professional for advice on the best type of cleanser to use for acne skin care. Acne skin care also means washing your skin after heavy exercise. Patients should wash their face from under the jaw to the hairline; rough scrubs or pads should not be used. It is important that patients thoroughly rinse their skin after washing it. Astringents are not recommended for acne skin care unless the skin is very oily, and then they should be used only on oily spots. Doctors also recommend that patients regularly shampoo their hair as part of acne skin care. Those with oily hair may want to shampoo it every day for proper acne skin care. People who squeeze, pinch, or pick their blemishes risk developing scars. Acne lesions can form in areas where pressure is frequently applied to the skin. Frequent rubbing and touching of skin lesions should be avoided if you take your acne skin care seriously. Men who shave and who have acne can try electric and safety razors to see which is more comfortable for acne skin care. Men who use a safety razor should use a sharp blade and soften their beard thoroughly with soap and water before applying shaving cream. Nicking blemishes can be avoided by shaving lightly and only when necessary. A suntan or sunburn that reddens the skin can make blemishes less visible and make the skin feel drier for a little while. But the benefits are only temporary and cannot take the place of proper acne skin care. The sun can seriously damage skin, promote aging of skin, and cause skin cancer. Furthermore, many of the medications used to treat acne make a person more prone to sunburn. People being treated for acne often need to change some of the cosmetics they use. Acne skin care demands that all cosmetics, such as foundation, blush, eye shadow, and moisturizers, should be oil free. Patients may find it difficult to apply foundation evenly during the first few weeks of treatment because skin may be red or scaly, particularly with the use of topical tretinoin or benzoyl peroxide. Lip products that contain moisturizers may cause small, open and closed comedones to form. Hairstyling products that come in contact with the skin along the hairline can cause burning or stinging in people with acne. Acne skin care products that are labeled as noncomedogenic (do not promote the formation of blemishes) should be used for acne skin care; in some people, however, even these products may cause acne.

Well, now that I do know, with the staggering number of acne patients left (last time I stumbled on the number, we are talking 50 million plus people folks!), I feel the least I can do is inform or better still remind the public of this simple discipline towards acne treatment, naturally and permanently. I can boldly say, starting today, if you suffer from acne and want to see it gone, like I did so many years back You have to stop eating acid-forming/disease forming foods. In lay-man terms Junk and processed foods and drinks. How did I figure this out? Well, at the time I was a Michael Jackson fan and had read in some books on him that he as well as Jermaine, his brother, suffered from severe acne as teens but were able to control it with a change in their diet, from the Standard American diet to a healthier vegetarian one. Needless to say, I swore off junk food as the first step towards a successful acne treatment and started doing my own research to validate this claim and indeed, that suggestion is correct. “You are what you eat!” is a saying known all over the world, and what you consume has arguably the most effect on your overall health. Now since the skin, according to Dr. Stanley Burroughs, is the second most important eliminating organ, it only makes sense that what is consumed should not leave a detrimental residue to aggravate skin eruptions. Moreover, all processed and junk foods and even foods of the animal kingdom, tend to not only constipate the visceral organs, but they poison the blood, which my friends aggravates the other causes of poor health like stress, insomnia and the like. Remember, blood DOES flow through the brain. No one is saying that other factors like losing a job, death and the like don’t still exist. Far from it, but from an internal point of view, you have to make the effort to change your diet for not only acne treatment but overall improved health and fitness. That said, herein lies a suggestion for a successful treatment of acne conditions. No, I’m not a religious fanatic but hey the Creator cannot be wrong folks “Every herb bearing Seed and ever fruit bearing see in it shall be yours for food. Gen 1 29” Okay, I’ll break it down, for a successful acne treatment, eat more (if not exclusively) Fruits and vegetables. Of course they are best enjoyed raw AND organic (if possible), but can be also relished properly cooked. (So don’t steam with excess water AND by all means AVOID THE MICROWAVE-trust me I know what I’m saying) Also, for external acne treatments ensure that you change the pillow-case nightly if possible, sleep on the right side (face clearly off the pillow), avoid harsh chemicals, avoid positioning your face underneath a shower (especially when it’s hot)…this for 2 reasons-doing so introduces harmful chlorine into your lungs and from my experience, aggravates acne by drying out the skin and consequently suggesting to the dermis that it needs to produce more oil than needed to lubricate the skin. You may want to pick up facial massaging or simply washing the face with cool water. In addition, it doesn’t hurt to occasionally steam your face. Try using boiled DISTILLED water though for the same reasons on avoiding Chlorine inhalation above. Now, you try this for a week and I bet you, you will see a drastic improvement in your skin condition via this superior, yet common sense method of acne treatment. Sincerely, Foras Aje PS It’s been fun writing this, but I wanted to add…throw in a fast or a restricted fruit diet of a seasonal Juicy fruit for just 3 days with the external factors above. You will thank me that I told you this…trust me. "},{"title":" Acne Treatment- Do You Know What Is Acne?

Apart from causing unsightly physical appearance, it carries a multitude of psychological effects that affects teens in different ways, especially if it is of the severe type. Teens being a very self conscious lot are greatly affected by acne making them have low self esteem. This might lead to them shunning social settings due to perceptions of others. So what are the social ramifications that this condition brings? Those suffering from acne have often been accused by their non-acne friends of being overly-sensitive. However the physical and psychological problems suffered by them have been recognized nowadays as being real and efforts have been made to deal with them appropriately. Acne is every bit as much how you feel as it is about how you look. This is much more so with teens who usually judge by physical appearances. In a society which places high value on the physical, and sets high standards for them to comply to the \"norms\", teens suffering from acne are particularly disadvantaged. The teens suffering from acne often feel they are ugly and this feeling might extend with adult acne. Parents are constantly faced with a dilemma on how to deal with their children who are afflicated with acne and experience feelings of depressions and inferiority. Often it is difficult to discern whether the psychological traumas passing through the teens are acne related, or are the usual tantrums and emotional phases that characterizes teenage hood.This makes it difficult to understand the psychological effects associated with acne. The simplest and most effective way of understanding this psychological effects is just listening.By listening to how acne makes them feel and the insecurities it causes them, parents can show that they emphathise with them and care. Additionaly informing them on the causes , types and treatment can reassure them that they aren't viewed as being dirty or having poor hygiene. Hygiene doesn't directly cause acne.Parents should also let them know that teenagers all over face the same issues with acne, thus showing them that they aren't alone in this.

Some are lucky and only ever get a pimple or two, but for many, acne can be a socially demoralizing condition... and it's not just in teens, adult suffer too. Studies suggest that 20-25% of males and 40-45% of females suffer prolonged bouts/occurrences of acne, whether it be persistent acne or regular breakouts. In a lot of cases, the acne treatment that is administered ends up making the situation worse and can be damaging to the skin. You see, most people either scrub their skin really hard in the hope of cleaning it more thoroughly, and some see a pimple and just can't wait to squeeze it. That's the wrong approach for 2 reasons. First and most importantly, when you are squeezing your skin you are damaging it. Our skin is a very fragile commodity, and acne scars happen all so easy, so squeezing pimples isn't desirable. Second, when you squeeze a pimple or scrub the skin very hard, you invariably push some of the sebum (the oil that causes the pimple) back into the pore and down the hair follicle shaft. This can magnify the problem by creating a further blockage and swelling which may just end up causing an infection. So instead of suffering once, you suffer twice. To better understand how acne happens, we can simply describe it as the result of the blockage of a skin pore. The blockage is typically caused by excess sebum and/or dead skin cells which haven't exited the hair follicle via the skin pore. (Sebum is naturally occurring fatty oil that moisturizes the skin and hair. Without it, your hair would be thin and brittle, and your skin would be dry and hard). What happens is that as your body continually replaces its skin, sometimes the skin cells do not shed evenly causing a blockage. The sebum (oils) keep producing in the hair follicle and when these oils cannot exit via the pore, they back-up in the follicle and swelling occurs.... and you have a pimple! Acne treatment is a science that is progressing at a phenomenal rate. In the 80's and 90's the best acne treatment on offer were chemical-based products that worked for most cases. Some were very harsh on the skin, and some actually made the situation worse. In recent years, a switch to a natural acne treatment has seen far more positive results because scientists have been able to study closer how/why the acne is caused, and apply ingredients that actually correct the problem rather than mask it. So what is the best way to treat acne ? The best acne treatment for you will obviously be the one that rids you of your unwanted condition quickly and with little or no side effects. But there are just so many products to choose from and so many different approaches/rationales. Some say that all acne is caused by hormonal imbalances, some say that it is totally to do with skin care and hygiene. Reality suggests that it is a combination of these two variables. The human body is an ever-changing organism and it needs balance, so an approach that recognizes this fact could very well be labelled as the best acne treatment. Choosing your solution is more complex than this. For example, should the best treatment for adult acne differ from the best treatment for teenage acne ?

Although there's no universal cure, acne is definitely easier to treat now than it used to be. However, finding the right acne treatment product is still a mystery for many of the sufferers. Despite all the scientific knowledge today, people still think that acne is caused by particular things we do. Actually, it is mostly a combination of factors underneath our skin that lead to acne. The good news that there are acne treatment products that can eliminate it completely in about 95% of all cases. Your skin has many wonderful features that help it recover completely even from serious acne if treated properly * It is self healing. * It is very elastic. * It registers and remembers sensations very precisely. * It is very resilient. * It is self-cleaning and hardly ever suffers any serious infection. * It lets in some elements and protects you from others. * It holds in the entire amount of liquid that flows through your body. Salicylic Acid There's a lot of evidence that salicylic acid is one of the most effective approach on acne problems. It decreases the number of primary acne lesions, as well as the number and severity of all lesions associated with acne. Salicylic acid is safe to use even on dark skin and gives good and fast results. Glycolic Acid Among popular alpha hydroxyl acids, glycolic acid is one of the most commonly used. It has similar results with a chemical peel. Even when used in strong concentrations, glycolic acid has only few negative side effects. Long-term day to day use may also have a beneficial effect on acne scars. Glycolic acid is also effective in increasing skin resistance to ultraviolet light, improving moisture retention, as well as the general skin condition. However, even though it is quite effective and has only minor side effects, it is better to use as part of a more complex skin care system. Benzoyl Peroxide Benzoyl peroxide is a widely used ingredient in acne treatment products. It used to be very popular in the 1930s, but since then, medical science has come up with new and more effective treatments. However, many dermatologists are still pleading for the benefits of acne treatment products that contain Benzoyl peroxide. In addition to its antibacterial effect, Benzoyl peroxide apparently has an anti-oxidant action as well. Among its most common side effects is dry and irritated skin. Many acne treatment products available on the market today use one of the ingredients mentioned above in combination with other ingredients. Some of the most famous and effective products against acne are ProAcrive, ZENMED Derma Cleanse System, Accutane and Benzoyl Peroxide.

One of the products that have been swiping the markets is acne soap, almost every cosmetics and dermatology company that respects itself has some kind of acne soap out there for the public to use, many soaps may cause irritation to some of its users, some soaps are scented and some users are irritated by them too. Soaps have become the number one product to fight acne. These anti acne soaps come in two different forms, in liquid or in classic bar shape, most of the soaps have a similar version in bar or liquid so it is really the preference of the user if he or she likes this form or the other better. Cleansers are used to fight and remove oil and dirt from the surface of the face thus cleaning and “opening” it. this is not a one step procedure, the cleaning is a first step, allowing the active topical acne cleaner to treat the acne and decrease it. One major problem with teens using these soap and anti acne treatments is that they are too eager to eliminate their acne that they overuse the products, this may cause other problems, as the use of soap on the face skin creates dryness and irritation. In this case there should be a regular, and steady use of the treatment products, and not an acne blitz to try and eliminate acne immediately, this simply does not work. Another important factor is the kind of skin the user has, it is important to know and understand what kind of skin you have before you even buy your acne treatment products, soaps or cleansers. Dry or oily skin require a product that will treat the face skin accordingly, otherwise the user may make his problem worst than better, this is very important, and this should not be left for the salesperson to deiced. Users with dry skin should gentle cleansers and soaps, as they will feel an aggressive one immediately and it would not help their condition. Synthetic detergents are sometimes recommended for dry skin, they should not be used often and have been known to work well on that skin type. One skin type that needs to be most careful of all is a sensitive skin type, if you have sensitive skin you should be very careful with what you use, try and make sure well in advance that the product is fro sensitive skin and that it will not hurt your skin face, try not to use any products that require scrubbing or aggressive washing, look for gentle soaps and liquids, cleansers and special sensitive skin products. It is important to know what you are shopping for and what kind of skin you have, before you even go out to the shop. You should put some thought into the acne treatment that you are going to use, and think about a long term fight against acne and not a one day effort, find a product you like and that is good for you, and use it every couple of days, always read the instructions and use common sense when looking for new products.

Other ingredients of the oil on the skin are- sweat, lipids and environmental dirt. It is sebum, which contributes a lot to our body odor. Sebum itself is odorless but its bacterial disintegration produces odor. That is why if you keep your skin clean of bacteria with anti bacterial soaps regularly, you can reduce body odor to a great extent. Sebum reaches hair follicles and coats the hair and also reaches the skin through the hair follicles. Many people experience oily hair if hair is left unwashed for few days. That happens because of sebum. The Latin meaning of sebum is fat. How sebum is produced- sebum is produced by sebaceous glands. These glands are found on most parts of the body. Except few, most sebaceous glands open into a hair follicle. These are the sites of acne formation. What does sebum do- sebum protects skin from bacterial infection. Sebum also reduces the natural water loss of body from the skin. Increased sebum production can cause acne. Sebum production- sebum production decreases with age. Particularly in women it reduces after menopause. Adult females produce less sebum than men. Sebum production may experience jump at the time of puberty in men. There are some common theories about sebum. Some people believe that drying excess sebum with blotting oils will reduce sebum production. Some believe that if you use products supposed to control oil production that will increase sebum production. Both are wrong conclusions. Drying excess oil will only remove surface oil. And using oil control products will not increase sebum production. Sebum is required to protect our skin, but increased production of sebum leads to oily skin and frequent acne flare-ups.

If untreated, it can last for many years, although acne usually clears up as you get older. The following treatments, however, generally can keep acne under control. 1. Use topical benzoyl peroxide lotion or gel Benzoyl peroxide helps kill skin bacteria, unplug the oil ducts and heal acne pimples. It is the most effective acne treatment you can get without a doctor's prescription. Many brands are available in different levels of strength (2.5 percent, 5 percent or 10 percent). Read the labels or ask your pediatrician or pharmacist about it. * Start slowly with a 2.5 percent or 5 percent lotion or gel once a day. After a week, increase use to twice a day (morning and night) if your skin isn't too red or isn't peeling. * Apply a thin film to the entire area where pimples may occur. Don't just dab it on current blemishes. Avoid the delicate skin around the eyes, mouth and corner of the nose. * If your acne isn't better after four to six weeks, you may increase to a 10 percent strength lotion or gel. Start with one application each day and increase to two daily applications if your skin tolerates it. 2. If you don't see results, consult your pediatrician Your doctor can prescribe stronger treatments, if needed, and will teach you how to use them properly. Three kinds of medications may be recommended * TRETINOIN (RETIN-A) CREAM OR GEL helps unplug oil ducts but must be used exactly as directed. Be aware that exposure to the sun (or tanning parlors) can cause increased redness in some people who are using the medication. * TOPICAL ANTIBIOTIC SOLUTIONS may be used in addition to other medications for a type of acne called pustular acne. * ORAL ANTIBIOTIC PILLS may be used in addition to creams, lotions or gels if your acne doesn't respond to topical treatments alone. 3. What about the \"miracle drug\" Accutane? Isotretinoin (Accutane) is a very strong chemical taken in pill form. It is used only for severe cystic acne that hasn't responded to any other treatment. Accutane must NEVER be taken just before or during pregnancy. There is a danger of severe or even fatal deformities to unborn babies whose mothers have taken Accutane while pregnant or who become pregnant soon after taking Accutane. You should never have unprotected sexual intercourse while taking Accutane. Patients who take Accutane must be carefully supervised by a doctor knowledgeable about its usage, such as a pediatric dermatologist or other expert on treating acne. Your pediatrician may require a negative pregnancy test and a signed consent form before prescribing Accutane to females. If you are experiencing acne problems, remember that your pediatrician can help you. And as you begin treatment, keep these helpful tips in mind * Be patient. It takes three to six weeks to see any improvement. Give each treatment enough time to work. * Be faithful. Follow your program every day. Don't stop and start each time your skin changes. Remember, sometimes your skin may appear to worsen early in the program before you begin to see improvement. * Follow directions. Not using the treatment as directed is the most common reason the treatment fails. * Don't use medication prescribed for someone else. This holds true for all medications, especially Accutane. Doctors prescribe medication specifically for particular patients. What's good for a friend may be harmful for you. Never take Accutane that's prescribed for another person. * Don't overdo it. Too much scrubbing makes skin worse. Too much benzoyl peroxide or Retin-A cream makes your face red and scaly. Too much oral antibiotic may cause side effects.

The most popular way to treat mild to moderate acne is by using a topical treatment. These treatments can be in the form of a gel, cream, lotion or on a pad. They are applied to the surface of your skin, hence the name topical. The two main over the counter topic treatments are Salicylic acid and Benzoyl peroxide. Prescription Salicylic acid and Benzoyl peroxide are also available in stronger doses if required. Doctors my also prescribe ointments containing sulfur, tetracycline, erythromycin or a retinoid. Many times you will need to use a combination of the above treatments for best results. Salicylic acid and retinoids are used to treat the clogged hair follicles that are causing the acne lesions. They penetrate the pores and help the dead skin cells dissolve. Benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, tetracycline and erythromycin are antibacterial ointments used to treat the inflammation and kill the bacteria in the blocked follicles. For people with moderate to server acne, in addition to topical treatments they my also require some type of oral medication to treat their acne. The three types of oral medications are antibiotics, hormones, and isotretinoins. All three require a prescription. Tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin, and doxycycline are the most common prescribed antibiotics. They work by being absorbed through the digestive system, then into the blood, and then into the hair follicles where they kill bacteria and reduce inflammation. This option would be used when topical antibiotic treatments were unsuccessful. Hormones are an option available to treat teenage girls and women with acne. They are usually taken in the form of a birth control pill. They work by increasing the level of female hormones in the bloodstream. This helps reduce the production of androgen, which will then reduce the production of sebum. For severe acne, isotretinoin is often used. It is a powerful drug that treats acne by stopping all of the changes in the skin that causes acne. It kills bacteria, reduces sebum production, and slows the growth of skin cells. All of the above acne treatment options should be reviewed carefully prior to use. As with any type of medication they all present some type of risk or side effect.

Well, the answer to this is that all medications can potentially cause side effects. Every person's skin will react differently to different drugs or medications. Let's take a look at this whole thing objectively, shall we? Or at least, with as much objectivity a single person can have. Hopefully, if we do that we can find the best acne medication, or at least something close to it.  In theory, there may be no such thing as a “best” medication, as individual skin chemistry can easily get in the way. First off, over-the-counter medication for your average range of skin infections, let alone acne, is nowhere near as potent as your typical prescription treatment. This may stem from either the differences in the basic chemical composition or how concentrated the key ingredients of the treatments are. A prescription acne treatment may clear up the problem faster, but the potency of the chemicals can cause side effects more readily than the over-the-counter variants. That means that your life can get back to normal a lot faster, seeing as how you've got one less thing to worry about. However, despite being “less effective” (and that's something that's just this side of being arguable), over-the-counter stuff is significantly cheaper. Unless you've somehow gotten a case of monumentally bad acne, you should go and try an over-the-counter treatment first. They may not be as potent, but they very often can do the job on their own. If they're not helping, you shouldn't hesitate to seek professional help. Medical insurance may or many not entirely cover your costs, as this sort of thing is something that varies depending on the details of your coverage. The lower potency of the drugs can also be a boon rather than a bane, for some people. You see, every once in a while, the combination of skin, acne, and other factors is going to produce a person with very sensitive skin. The kind of skin that turns red and swells to the size of a grapefruit at the slightest touch of benzoyl peroxide, or something similar. However, lower chemical potency means that you're also less likely to run into a nasty side effect. There's also the matter of convenience to be considered here. An over-the-counter product is obviously easier to get your hands on. Go to a drug store, find medication for acne that you like or think would work, and pay for it at the counter. Simple, clean, and there's not a whole lot of time involved. In contrast, if you need to get one that's prescription-required, that involves the time to set up the appointment, the consultation, and all that other good stuff. There's also the matter of an individual's skin. Your skin is unique and how it might react to something is different from how someone else's skin might react. Your skin may be tougher than most, or it can be easier to scar than most. Medications are set to a specific formula when they're made. Finally, you may want to keep in mind not to mix and match your treatments. Drug interaction is a leading cause of side effects, aside from poor interaction with the patient's skin. Skin infections like acne can be made worse if you mix two treatments together, such as benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. The warning about drug interaction holds true even when you mix together over-the-counter medication and prescription ones, even if the two have ingredients in common.

Most people want to get rid of acne forever, and never be bothered with zits and blackheads again. The problem can be embarrassing and hard to control, especially among teenagers, who almost always suffer from some sort of acne. Acne is a part of adolescence and cannot be gotten rid of entirely, but it can be controlled and the effects lessened. Here are the top nine acne treatments 1. First, while the old myth that fried foods and chocolate has been disproved, eating right and having good nutrition helps the body and strengthens the immune system, so proper diet is still recommended. Eating whole grains, vegetables, lean meats, fruits and only limited dairy products can help. Also made sure that you are getting enough vitamins and minerals in your diet. It might be necessary take a good quality vitamin supplement. Along with a healthy diet, getting plenty of exercise will go a long way to good health in general and a healthy immune system. Moderate amounts of exercise three times a week will improve health. Avoiding smoking, alcohol and dangerous drugs is a given. 2. Next, it is important to practice proper hygiene. There is an old myth that says acne comes from bad hygiene, and that is not true, but acne will certainly take advantage of chances to grow. One of the causes of acne is a bacterium on and under the skin. Moderate washing will help. Also exfoliating with a mild over the counter exfoliate helps many people. 3. Next, take a look at the topical antibiotics and antibacterial agents available in many of the over the counter medications and washes sold to help acne. The good ones may contain Benzoyl peroxide, the most common acne treatment available without a doctor’s prescription. It kills the bacteria and the pimples do not develop a resistance to the medication. For this reason Benzoyl peroxide will not loose its effectiveness in fighting and killing bacteria. If using it, begin with a low concentration and work up. Be sure when you buy it that it is non-comedogenic, which means that the medication will not clog the pores. If you are into natural remedies, tea tree oil is a popular natural remedy that works the same way Benzoyl peroxide works, but is less irritating to the skin. 4. Another over the counter acne remedy that works and is popular is salicylic acid. Salicylic acid unplugs the pores and helps to get rid of dead skin cells, which attract bacteria and make acne worse. There are many good over the counter remedies available that contain salicylic acid and it is good to use it in conjunction with Benzoyl peroxide.  The two make a good two-fisted team. 5. Sulfur works in many ways like Benzoyl peroxide. It is not as widely used, however, it is believed to be not quite as effective. However, if for some reason you cannot use tea tree oil or Benzoyl peroxide, the by all means give sulfur a try. 6. Glycolic acid is another ingredient that works. It gets rid of dead skin and it stimulates the production of new cells, which many believe will help unclog pores. 7. Light therapy and acupuncture are two natural remedies that have their fans. Acupuncture also usually involves changing diet and lifestyle and according to the practitioners who use it can cure the root causes of acne. Light therapy is expensive, but for many very helpful. It involves treatments of light in wavelength that many believe kills bacteria, and if it doesn’t work, at least does no harm because light at the wavelength used is not harmful to skin. 8. If the above remedies are not making a visible difference, visiting a doctor can result in prescriptions for antibiotics that are known to be effective. Erythromycin, Benzaclin, Duac, benzamycn, Sodium Sulfacetamide, and aazelic acid cream all work for many people. Tetracycline and the related cycline drugs also kill the bacteria when taken orally and help many. 9. Still the best cure for acne is simply age. Most people outgrow acne when they get through puberty and get into their early twenties. For some it sticks around a little longer, but with adulthood it usually goes away. But the good nutrition and hygiene habits you gain in fighting acne will stay with you and benefit you for a lifetime. Of course, it is always best to see your family doctor to get their opinion. If necessary, they'll refer you to a Dermatologist who will be able to help you.

If we allow acne to grow up to the third stage, it may burst and also leave permanent scars. ","keywords":" ","article_body":" Acne grows in stages. If we allow acne to grow up to the third stage, it may burst and also leave permanent scars. To understand how acne may be stopped to grow up to second or third stage, it is important to know more about the later stages of acne. Blackheads and whiteheads are first stages of acne. In the later stages they break out as papule, pustule, nodule and cyst. Let us find out more about them. What is a papule - a papule is a slightly elevated lesion that is solid. Papules are generally less than 5 mm in diameter. What is a pustule- pustules are filled with pus that contains dead skin cells, white blood cells and bacteria. Pustules are fragile and can easily break. Pustules are dome shaped and contain a hair in the center when they form over a sebaceous hair follicle. Pustules can progress to cyst. What is a Nodule- a nodule is an inflamed lesion that extends to deeper layers of skin. A nodule looks like a papule and is dome shaped like a papule. Nodules can cause scarring as they damage the inner tissues of the skin. What is a cyst- a cyst is severe form of acne that is filled with bacteria, white blood cells and dead skin. Cysts can be very painful and extend inside the skin damaging the skin tissue. Any acne that damages the skin tissue deep inside can form scars. For the above forms of acne, it is always better that you consult a dermatologist and get treated not only to cure the acne quickly but also stop scarring as much as possible. Please remember that acne may get healed but scars always remain for the lifetime. It is better to get cured at an early stage to prevent inflammation and stop scarring.

"},{"title":" Acne Treatments with the Use of Birth Control Pills and Antibiotics ","word_count":871,"summary":" Birth control pills helps in preventing acne growth. ","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" Acne / Birth Control Pill For some female patients, treatment-resistant acne is caused by excessive production of hormones called androgens. With extra androgens in your system, your oil-producing glands go into high gear ­— and so does your acne. Several clues can help your doctor identify acne that may be influenced by hormones acne that appears in adults for the first time; acne flare-ups preceding the menstrual cycle; irregular menstrual cycles; hirsutism (excessive growth of hair or hair in unusual places); and elevated levels of certain androgens in the blood stream. Adult women and teenage girls whose acne has resisted treatment with antibiotics or topical retinoids may be candidates for hormonal therapy. Once a patient’s acne is identified as hormonally influenced, the doctor will be able to prescribe a number of different therapies, or perhaps a combination of several different drugs; \"combination therapy\" is often the best approach to this kind of acne. Following are a few common components of therapy for hormonal acne, but remember to consult your doctor before using any of the remedies listed here. Acne / Birth Control Pill - Oral contraceptives. Birth-control pills (a combination of estrogen and progestin taken orally) are often prescribed for hormonal acne. Low doses of estrogen help suppress the androgens produced by the ovaries, and the newer progestin agents, including desogestrel and norgestimate, are less androgenic than those found in older formulations. While only Ortho Tri-Cyclen and Estro-Step are currently approved by the FDA for this indication, experts agree that low-dose contraceptives improve acne regardless of which formula is used. Consult your gynecologist to find the formula that’s right for you. While side effects are uncommon, some women may experience brownish blotches, or melasma (hyperpigmentation) on the skin. These can be treated with topical bleaching agents. Acne / Birth Control Pill - Anti-androgens. In combination with oral contraceptives, doctors also may prescribe an anti-androgen ; these drugs inhibit androgen production in the ovaries and adrenal glands and help prevent existing androgens from causing excessive oil production. Spironolactone, a high blood pressure medicine with anti-androgenic properties, has proven quite effective in the treatment of acne. Side effects may include breast tenderness, menstrual irregularities (in women not using oral contraceptives), headache and fatigue; since it's also a diuretic, you may experience frequent urination as well. NOTE Spiranolactone is tetrogenic and can cause feminization of a male fetus. If you are sexually active and not taking “the pill,” it’s imperative that you use another form of birth control. Acne / Birth Control Pill - Corticosteroids. Small doses of corticosteroids, like prednisone or dexamethasone, may curb inflammation and suppress the androgens produced by the adrenal glands. Keep in mind that in some acne sufferers, corticosteroids may actually aggravate acne; they’re most effective when used in combination with oral contraceptives. In conclusion, if you think your acne is hormonally induced, see your doctor right away. While this kind of acne requires a different course of treatment, it is highly treatable. More about your hormones. For patients who suffer from moderate to severe acne, doctors may prescribe a combination of topical remedies and oral antibiotics. The most common oral medications used to treat acne are tetracycline, minocycline, doxycycline and erythromycin. Antibiotics for Acne - HOW THEY WORK Like Benzoyl Peroxide, antibiotics control breakouts by curbing the body’s production of P. acnes, the bacteria that causes acne, and decreasing inflammation. This process may take several weeks or months, so be patient. And remember, you’re not “cured” just because your breakouts have subsided. That’s the medicine doing its job — so if you stop taking it, your acne will probably come back. Likewise, doubling up on your medication won’t make your skin clear up twice as fast. Using your topical antibiotics more frequently than prescribed may actually induce greater follicular irritation and plugging, which slows clearing time. And taking your oral medications more often than prescribed won’t help your skin clear faster — but it will increase your chance of experiencing unpleasant side effects. Antibiotics for Acne - WHERE TO GET THEM If you have moderate to severe acne, consult your dermatologist; he or she will discuss your options and help you make the best choice. Once you’ve begun treatment, give it time to start working. Keep your doctor apprised of your progress, so he or she can make changes to the course of treatment if necessary. And again, don’t stop using your medication when your skin clears — let your doctor make that call. Antibiotics for Acne - COMMON SIDE EFFECTS With most of the antibiotics used to treat acne, side effects may include photosensitivity (higher risk of sunburn), upset stomach, dizziness or lightheadedness, hives, lupus-like symptoms and skin discoloration. Some women report a higher incidence of vaginal yeast infection while taking antibiotics; these can usually be treated with over-the-counter antifungal medication or a prescription antifungal, such as diflucan. Tetracycline is not given to pregnant women or children under 12 years of age because it can discolor developing teeth. Lastly (and least common), because doxycycline is also the treatment of choice for Lyme disease, there is the theoretical possibility that a patient who takes this medication for a long period of time would build a resistance, and therefore be unable to fight Lyme.

You get them both as OTC products and as prescription strength formulations. If you are prone to regular outbreak of acne, it is time for you to think using AHAs regularly to prevent them. Let us discuss why I think AHAs may work as preventives. Acne and pore block- One of the main reasons of acne formation is blockage of the pore. If the pore remains open, acne would not form because excess sebum will go out on the skin and get washed away. The blocked pore allows sebum accumulation and inflammation. AHAs and pores- AHAs are acidic molecules commonly found in milk, sugarcane juice and many other natural products. These acids perform a very important function on the skin. They dissolve the cement that holds the dead skin cells together and remove the dead cells from the skin surface. While doing this, they open the pores. If you use AHAs everyday, your skin gets very little opportunity to get blocked. Please talk to your doctor and find out if you should use them and if yes, what strength.

From the start of the teenage years, almost everyone will suffer from some form of acne. It is ain inflammation of the skin that causes irritated sores, commonly on the face. This can lead to low self-esteem, embarrassment, and depression so it is important to treat it and take care of your skin. The cause of acne vulgaris can be due to a number of different factors. Stress, hormones, and pore-blocking dead skin and oil are some of the most common reasons that people develop acne. It is also an inherited characteristic that you could get from your parents. Stress changes the level of hormones and neuro-active substances that cause acne. A way to treat this type of break-out is to take some time to relax and de-stress your mind by exercising or writing. Find something that you enjoy doing and practice it when you are feeling particularly stressed over something Hormone changes that occur during the teenage years can trigger acne vulgaris to flare up. This production of hormones is referred to as androgens. They stimulate oil glands to over-produce and contribute to developing blemishes. It is a common misconception that all acne is the result of being unclean. If this was true, most people would not ever have to deal with acne. When natural skin oil is combined with normal skin bacteria and dead skin cells, the dead skin gets forced to the surface. The greater the amount of oil that is produced, the better the chance it as of clogging your pores. Clogged pores are where bacteria feed to produce inflammation, which results in pimples. Washing your face cannot treat a condition that develops primarily under the skin. The effects of having acne vulgaris can be long-term if untreated. If the condition is severe, there is a chance for permanent scars to form. Most teenagers have trouble dealing with the way they feel when they have break-outs. Social situations are avoided at all costs to prevent the embarrassment of a flawed appearance. Some people go as far as missing school because of the appearance of acne vulgaris. Severe depression could also result from unhappiness with the appearance of their skin. Self-esteem and self-worth seem to diminish completely unless their skin is absolutely flawless. There is not a guaranteed cure for these feelings, however, getting an effective acne treatment could eliminate appearance from being the cause of it. Treatment for acne vulgaris is as simple as finding which medicine works best for you. Severe acne is usually treated by a dermatologist who will prescribe a medication specific to your needs. If the acne is less severe or occasional, an over-the-counter solution could be best for you. There are all types of factors that contribute to the development of blemishes so when picking out the right medicine, consider the specificity of your skin. If you notice that your skin is especially oily, then be sure that you use something that will target the oil. Blackheads and whiteheads are also a target area of some treatments available.

","keywords":" acne, treatment, skin care ","article_body":" Acne lesions range in severity from comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) to  nodules and cysts. Here is a brief definition of acne lesions Comedo (plural comedones)-A comedo is a sebaceous follicle  plugged with sebum, dead cells from inside the sebaceous follicle, tiny hairs,  and sometimes bacteria. When a comedo is open, it is commonly called a blackhead  because the surface of the plug in the follicle has a blackish appearance. The  antioxidant Acnezine regulates the sebaceous glands thus  controlling the oil secretion and stops acne growth permanently. Neither  blackheads nor whiteheads should be squeezed or picked open, unless extracted by  a dermatologist under sterile conditions. Papule-A papule is defined as a small (5 millimeters or  less), solid lesion slightly elevated above the surface of the skin. A group of  very small papules and microcomedones may be almost invisible but have  “sandpaper” feel to the touch. A papule is caused by localized cellular reaction  to the process of acne. Prolong treatment with Ancezine smoothes  the lesion to a great extent.Pustule-a dome-shaped, fragile lesion containing pus that  typically consists of a mixture of white blood cells, dead skin cells, and  bacteria. A pustule that forms over a sebaceous follicle usually has a hair in  the center. Acne pustules that heal without progressing to cystic form usually  leave no scars. Nodule-like a papule, a nodule is a solid, dome-shaped or  irregularly shaped lesion. Unlike a papule, a nodule is characterized by  inflammation, extends into deeper layers of the skin and may cause tissue  destruction that results in scarring. A nodule may be very painful. Nodular acne  is a severe form of acne that may not respond to therapies other than  isotretinoin. Cyst-a cyst is a sac-like lesion containing liquid or  semi-liquid material consisting of white blood cells, dead cells, and bacteria.  It is larger than a pustule, may be severely inflamed, extends into deeper  layers of the skin, may be very painful, and can result in scarring. Cysts and  nodules often occur together in a severe form of acne called nodulocystic.

Some adults feel so embarrassed that they want to hide acne from other people’s sight.  Studies have shown some growing evidence on acne, that it can be a hereditary disease too apart from occurring due to hormonal imbalances.  It is due to oil production and mismanagement of dead cells exfoliation.  Acne lesions in adults are normally seen on the face, but might also occur anytime on the chest, neck, back, scalp, legs, upper arms and even shoulders.  Adult acne is very persistent when compared to teen acne, as acne seen in teens subsides over time when the hormones get adjusted.  Another major drawback of adult acne is that it leads to permanent scarring. <b>Key Factors That Contribute to adult acne</b> Hormones are considered as the main culprit and mainly cause skin eruptions or outbreak of acne.  But, has anyone thought about the organs that produce the hormones?  The actual fact is that the kidneys, liver and skin are the important organs involved in eliminating impurities and waste particles from the body, if anyone of the organs does not work properly and does not eliminate waste out the body, it might result in acne in adults.  Acne or the skin eruption is the first symptom of failure these organs are facing.  To facilitate the elimination of waste from body water is very important, when water is taken in good quantities the bowels are cleared and the blood too gets rid of its toxic elements.  If water content decreases the skin might not do its function of eliminating wastes, or the lungs might not be able to oxygenize the blood due to the impurities of air is breathed and retained in it.  Hence, the factors for acne may be air, food, emotional stress, water etc. <b>Natural adult acne treatments </b> The wastes from the body should be eliminated properly to facilitate it the person should be exposed to pure air, water, natural food habits and, foods rich in antioxidants.  A natural face wash made up of clean, warm water with lemon juice can be used to pamper the skin.  The lemon has the ability to reduce oil from the skin, hence minimizing acne in adults.  Fiber rich food helps in the removal of toxins and wastes from the body by facilitating the bowel movements.  Also when using cosmetic products, care needs to be taken not to use oil-based cosmetics.

Though the general notion is that acne and pimple outbreaks are for prepubertal and teenaged populations, adult acne is not unusual. A majority of adults, who were lucky to be 'acne free' during their teenage years and who saw the desperation of their peers trying to combat acne, feel mortified when they find that just when they assumed they were free of acne for ever, they have become afflicted by adult acne. Most of the adults are confused and embarrassed. They wonder, isn't acne an adolescent problem? But the truth remains that adult acne is more widespread than imagined. Statistics show that in the United States alone, nearly 40% of all acne cure products are purchased and used by adult acne sufferers. What is the reason behind adult acne? Well. It is not one but many. However, the most universally attributed cause, that of bad personal hygiene, is a myth. Nearly all acne cases even adult acne, are a direct consequence of blocked pores on the skin or hormonal imbalances. Faulty closing of facial hair ducts or infection of the oil glands are a probable cause of adult acne. The good news is that acne can be cured to a greater or lesser degree. The bad news is that most adults, in their zeal to overcome the embarrassment of an adult acne outbreak, try the first remedy they can lay their hands on from their neighborhood drugstore. Little do they think that this could do more harm than good to their acne problem. The remedies found over the counter cater to acne problems of the majority of the younger populations. These medications and remedies might not have the potency or the capacity to deal with adult acne because the reasons of which may vary to a great degree. Adult acne demands tougher remedies despite the fact that adult acne is no different from regular acne. So what should be the first step to cure adult acne? A good idea is to consult the dermatologist to determine the underlying cause of what caused adult acne. The next step after the diagnosis is done is to use simple prescription drugs to eradicate the acne problem forever. However, there is one important piece of advice. All adult acne sufferers need not be embarrassed about their problem. Like I stated above, adult acne is commoner than imagined. So which option do you feel is better? To make that one visit to the dermatologist to do away with your acne problem or to spend a fortune at the local pharmacist in trying to find the elixir for acne in addition to the fear and worry that comes with it? Think about it. The choice is yours. "},{"title":" Adult Acne - Causes and Cures ","word_count":684,"summary":" Almost everyone will have some form of acne in their lives.

The myth is that once teenagers cross the threshold from adolescence into adulthood, the anguish caused by acne will be permanently left behind. The reality is that there is no guarantee that adulthood will offer the safe, acne-free haven that so many teens long for. Statistics indicate that 25% of the male population is plagued at some point by adult acne, while 50% of females will similarly find themselves contending with the condition as adults. It seems that no one is exempt.  Infant acne can appear on the faces babies who are only three or four weeks old, or even on the faces of newborns. Since so many are afflicted - adult and child alike - there's an obvious need for real information on acne skin care that cuts through all the myths and separates fact from fiction. Let’s begin at the beginning. Sebum is the natural oil produced by the skin's sebaceous glands. For reasons that aren't fully understood, the pores of the skin can become plugged with sebum, and once plugged, bacteria and dead cells can become trapped in the pores, resulting in the lesions common to acne. Acne can be defined as a condition describing blocked skin pores that result in lesions. The most common lesions are called comedones. There are two basic varieties of comedones ‘white heads’ and ‘black heads’. A white head is an occluded pore that has begun to bulge outward from the skin due to dead skin cells, bacteria, and other contaminants that have become trapped inside. This bulging dome shape often assumes a white appearance. Black heads are simply comedones that have opened, exposing the dark follicle mass inside. Acne comedones are often referred to colloquially as \"zits\" or \"pimples.\" Microcomedones are a less common form of acne lesion, sometimes referred to as papules.  These are basically small comedones that form from localized cellular reactions to the processes that cause acne.  They usually occur in clusters and are sometimes too small to see.  They can be felt as a series of little bumps along the skin surface. In more severe forms of acne, cysts, pustules and nodules and can form. A pustule is like a normal comedone, but larger due to a higher amount of dead white cells, or pus, trapped inside the plugged sebaceous follicle. Nodules are a more severe form of papules, extending deeper into the skin tissue and resulting in large raised legions that are usually inflamed and painful to touch. Finally, cysts are very large fluid filled sacs that can result from pustules or nodules. Though none of these forms of acne are dangerous or life threatening, they can leave scars and are sometimes very disfiguring. What causes acne? This is a question that scientists and doctors still haven’t been able to completely agree upon. Today, most theories seem to point to a combination of factors that include genetics, hormone changes, and stress. For years it was thought that diet was a strong component to acne, but most evidence today suggests that hormones and stress are more likely to be the culprits. Almost everyone will have some form of acne in their lives. Most people suffer from outbreaks of acne during their teenage years.  These outbreaks are associated with hormone changes that occur during puberty. It is equally common to men and women, and usually outbreaks appear on the face. However, acne can strike at any stage in adult life, and outbreaks can appear not only on the face, but on the back, neck, arms and legs. The good news is that the situation regarding acne and acne skin care is by no means hopeless.  Acne treatment exists.  And while it might not be realistic to expect some sort of magical acne cure, there are ways to effectively tackle the problem.

That’s probably related to the more varied and volatile hormone changes that accompany the adult physiology and lifestyle. Also, subtle early pre-menopausal changes in estrogen and testosterone may contribute. Women are subject to more stress than perhaps at any other time in history. There are more concrete demands and more mixed messages demanding personal and professional perfection. The price is often physical and emotional exhaustion and emotional stress. How is it possible for the skin to not respond badly as well? The final basic “cause” of adult acne is the same, abnormal response of the follicle lining cells to androgens. However, there are many more potential and identifiable causes in women, i.e. hormone medications, menses, pregnancy, personal care, etc. The following regimen is one which is typically recommended to varying degrees of adult acne - Non-comedogenic soaps, cosmetics, etc. Many skin cleansers, make-up, etc. actually leave residues which block pores, and can make acne worse. The products which are used should state that they do not exacerbate acne. Some have recommended a very inexpensive, \"natural\" topical antibiotic. Placing 1 tsp. of essence of lemon oil (found at supermarkets) in to 4 ounces (120 cc) of liquid soap. This is used for cleansing the skin - essence of lemon has antibacterial properties. - Topical antibiotics several antibiotics (esp. tetracycline types, erythromycin, clindamycin, etc..) are prescribed for adult acne twice daily. They usually come in a \"roll-on\" type bottle. - Topical Vitamin-A acid (e.g.. Retin-A) cause peeling of the superficial layer of the skin to lessen new comedone formation. Quite effective. Face gets \"raw\" if use to much. Must use a sunscreen. Takes 4-6 weeks of consistent use to attain benefit. - Facial cleansing people with adult acne usually have very clean skin because attention they give to this area. - UV light therapy should be done with great care and under the supervision of a dermatologist. - Oral antibiotics tetracylines or erythromycin are most commonly given by mouth for moderate to severe acne in adult. More expensive antibiotics are not necessarily any better than plain tetracycline. Tetracyclines work very well, however because they can discolor new bone formation, they are contra-indicated in youth who have not completed their permanent teeth, as well as pregnant and nursing females. - Isotretinoin (Accutane) is indicated in only the severest adult acne cases. It is highly effective at reducing sebum production, comedone formation, inflammation, etc. However, it can cause severe birth defects if taken while pregnant and runs the risk of toxicity, requiring certain laboratory monitoring prior to and during therapy. It usually needs to be taken for at least 20 weeks. All other adult acne therapy is stopped while on isotretinoin. In general, it’s not how you wash, what you eat, what you drink, or impure thoughts. The over-the-counter, television, and internet “miracle cures” are too good to be true. REALLY. You need real therapy that can clear your skin.

However the truth is that a large number of adults do suffer from it. This leads to physical, psychological and social effects on persons suffering from acne. This effects can be long-lasting and cause problems. With adults, acne leaves behind permanent and ugly scars since as the skin ages and loses collagen, it takes longer for the scars to heal. It may be hard to diagnose psychological effects due to common misconceptions that accompany them. For instance it would be logical to say that the psychological effects of adult acne is easier to deal with since the person has matured and is not prone to teenage tantrums. However in actual reality the psychological effect in adults may be even worse, since this is a condition perceived to be specific to teens. Nowadays it is easier for adults to seek treatment from dermatologists as acne continues being recognized as a problem not confined only to teens but also to adults. Sales of over-the counter treatments have increased as well as awareness about adult acne. Research into adult acne has been extensively applied to determine it's causes and effects on older patients. this directly leads to increased awareness about the condition and makes it easier for more people to seek treatment. Nowadays information about the condition is readily available from the web, medical journals and publication. This means that the public can better understand it and how to combat it. More care is also given to the psychological effects it has on adults. Remember that they, just like teens are affected by people's attitudes towards them and how they are perceived.

Most of us have carried this burden in our teenage years and after almost seven teenage years we think we are finally home free. Then one morning in your twenty sixth, twenty seventh or even twenty eighth year of your existence you wake up with a huge zit on you face. And even worst, sometimes it is not just one but two or even three or even four! And they just keep on sprouting like weeds in an inhibited garden! So you wonder, I’m already an adult so why, why, WHY? Adult acne is more common than we thought. Almost five percent of adults have adult acne mostly in their twenties, thirties and even forties and beyond. Adult acne can be found in the face and sometimes even on the neck and on the chest and back area. There are many reasons for the occurrence of these devils incarnates and we will enumerate them here plus ways on how to outsmart them. Adult Acne Source Number 1 those pesky hormones And we all thought we are done with having problems caused by them! Apparently, they still have a last attack. Experts still can’t pinpoint the main reason why our oil glands are more prone to breakouts because of hormonal shifts in this age line. Unfortunately, these up and down hormonal shifts are the main culprit in adult acne. But fortunately, there’s an easy cure for these shifts and that is the common birth control pill. But take note that this is not applicable to you if you are pregnant. For stubborn and hard to kill zits, you may also use medication that has the ingredient retinoids that can help unclog those pores. If still doesn’t work then it’s high time to up your ammunition. Use antibiotics (may be topical or even oral) to reduce the swelling. Adult Acne Source Number 2 stress Stress is also a major source of adult acne. But we can’t help it, can we? Our world is full of stress inducing situation and things that it is already a part of our daily lives. We have bills to pay, kids to feed and a house to clean. So much stress we endure in a day that it results to the dreaded adult acne. This happens because stress triggers the body to secrete cortisol that results in the secretion of more hormones thus resulting to zits. So what do we do when the bump pops? Relax! Do some de-stressing. Go on a vacation or just spend a day doing nothing. Eat right, sleep right and do your exercise routine regularly. If your darn acne are still there after doing these things for a month or two then it is high time to see your dermatologist for some treatment and prescription. Adult Acne Source Number 3 Daily Grooming Products It is a fact that as we grow older we tend to become more vain especially in our twenties to thirties when we are still finding our ideal mate. We tend to use a lot of products to make ourselves more attractive to the opposite sex. Unfortunately, this only results to adult acne as these products tend to block pores which can result to zits erupting like crazy in our pretty little faces. How ironic, isn’t it? We bought and used these products to make ourselves more pretty only to have these little craters embed in our face. So what to do? Simplify! You don’t need all these products to make yourself pretty. Just use basics like moisturizer, cleanser and sun block. Purchase cosmetics that are noncomedogenic and make sure that they are oil free especially your moisturizer. And always remember your acne 101 do not touch your face or rest your pretty little chin in your grubby little hands!

Adult Acne Facts Doctors say adult acne is a common problem, but unfortunately an under-recognized one. Most people think acne it just for kids, but it can happen in later years too. It is more common in women than in men. Statistics show that acne affects about 25% of all adult men and 50% of all adult women at some point during their adult life. At the bottom of acne lies the pimple, which doctors call comedo. A pimple is a plug of fat, skin debris and keratin stuck in a hair duct. When it is open, we call it a blackhead and when it's closed over, a whitehead. Whiteheads can cause the walls of the hair duct to rupture, leading to redness, infection and cysts of acne. Many people think that acne is a result of poor hygiene, but this is not true. Both adult and teen acne are caused by a combination of many factors, such as excess oil production, faulty closing of the hair duct or infection. Washing your face gently only twice a day is actually much better than washing it more often. Adult Acne Treatment You can choose between an adult acne treatment in a dermatologist's office or at home. However, squeezing pimples at home often leads to infection and scars. Squeezing pimples is also a very effective way to get your acne to spread. Doctors, on the other hands, use special sterile instruments to prevent infection, scarring and acne spread. Another solution is to check your local drug store for adult acne treatments. If you've ever tried this, you know it's loaded with such products. With so many options available, choosing the right adult acne treatment can be quite difficult. A great progress in adult acne treatment has been the producing of the topical retinoid acid, a modified form of vitamin A. Improved versions of this medicine greatly reduce the irritation it can cause. Other acne treatments fight against different causes of acne. They are sometimes used in combination. Such acne treatments include * Azelaic acid cream * Benzoyl peroxide * Alpha-hydroxy acids (such as lactic acid, glycolic acid and gluconic acid) * Antibiotic pills (of used unwisely, they can lead to antibiotic resistance) * Topical antibiotics (gels, lotions and solutions) * Contraceptive pills for women * Sotret or Accutane for severe acne Accutane and Sotret have several side effects, including birth defects. Women with severe acne problems that choose these treatments should use alternative birth control. Despite the side effects they have, these treatments are probably the best choice for sever acne.

If you have suffered with acne breakouts your entire teenage years, you may understand what needs to be done for the treatment of your pimples, or you may know exactly the treatment product necessary for elimination and daily maintenance. However, if you had clear skin as a teen, and now that your body is changing due to hormones or pregnancy, you may suddenly experience a change in your complexion and may not know exactly how to handle the new changes in your skin. When your pimple breakouts occur, if you notice you're getting an increase in blackheads and whiteheads in combination to excess blemishes, try to think back and remember how your skin has been in the past. If  your skin was clear due to good eating habits, low stress levels, and you were getting at least 8 hours or more of sleep prior to getting your adult acne, then that's the first place you want to start. For example As a teenager, if you slept more than eight hours a day, drank plenty of water, and you ate more vegetables and fruit, and now as an adult you only get 4 hours of sleep, you drink less water, and you’re not eating the same level of fruits and veggies, then you may want to adjust these areas first. If you change these habits, and notice no change, you then have to go to the next step, and make an appointment to see a dermatologist. <b>When All Else Fails, Visit A Dermatologist To Get The Bottom Of Your Adult Acne Issues!</b> If you can’t figure out why you’re still having skin problems after you made necessary internal lifestyle changes, then you should see the skin professionals to find out what’s causing your stubborn adult zits, and you may be enlightened once you visit your local dermatologist. Depending on the severity of your skin condition, you may soon find out the condition you have is caused by several circumstances. For women, acne and increased blemishes can be easily caused by hormonal changes due to pregnancy. A woman that is pregnant will have to look at alternative safe skin programs, and natural skin products would be a place to start. Women with hormonal changes that are not currently going through a pregnancy can look at other options such as oral acne medication or antibiotics, but keep in mind that this method should not be a long-term solution, so if you can avoid internal medication, look at other alternatives. Men are somewhat different, and in most cases, increased acne causing a blemished complexion could be the lack of facial care, or mental stress in your life. For men in general, a good blemish cleansing and facial exfoliating routine combined with a healthy diet are the first steps to follow; however, we encourage that men see a skin doctor to assess their adult skin problems. Acne and aging is a complex situation, and there is never one solution to every individual adult suffering from pimple breakouts. There are many contributing factors such as your body’s changes during puberty, and for women, even the type of cosmetics you may be applying to your face. Your facial skin consists of thousands of pores, follicles, skin and oil. Any negative balance, and you have a recipe for facial infections, plus outbreaks that can lead to many skin imperfections and severe scarring for a very long time. We touched briefly on what may contribute to your adult acne, and some of the changes that may be occuring in your body internally and also externally.

Oily skin, hair ducts that do not close as they should and infection are three key factors which lead to skin problems. These factors remain the same, in both adults and teens. (How's that for thinking you wouldn't get acne, because you are an adult.) Pimples occur when dead skin, small deposits of fatty tissue and keratin get clogged in a hair duct. When the duct is open, this clogging produces a \"blackhead\". When the duct is closed, it is referred to as a \"whitehead\". Because a whitehead is closed, in most cases, it will eventually rupture. This bursting causes the redness and infection of adult acne. There are many myths associated with adult acne. Dermatologists tell us that acne is not caused by eating chocolate, fish or oily foods. Stress, in itself, does not cause acne. However, there are certain stress-relieving drugs that have been known to cause skin conditions.

Here are some tips in preventing and minimizing the effects of acne rosacea. ","keywords":" acne, proactiv, proactive, acne, treatment, beauty, tips, skin, care ","article_body":" Everybody knows what acne is, but what about acne rosacea? It is a condition that affects\tmany around the world, including such recent world leaders as former president Bill Clinton and Russian prime minister Boris Yeltsin. Acne rosacea is a chronic inflammation of the blood vessels in the skin and particularly facial area. It causes the face to have a rough complexion with multiple small acne patches on the forehead, nose, and cheeks. It is more commonly found in men where it causes the skin on the nose to swell and thicken. Untreated, this swelling of the nose could eventually lead to a condition called rhinophyma. There are many factors that pertain to rosacea outbreaks. Two of the most common causes are consuming alcoholic beverages and consuming rich, spicy foods. If someone thinks they may be suffering from acne rosacea, they should consult a physician, as its symptoms are similar to a more serious condition known as Lupus. Acne rosacea makes the face and skin more sensitive than healthy, uninjured skin. It attacks the skin through the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of skin. It is made up of dead skin cells that are held in place by keratin, a protein found in the body. The stratum corneum keeps molecules from passing in and out of the outer-most layer and protects the under layers of the skin, making them less susceptible to skin sensitivity. Healthy, unaffected skin has a lower chance of being irritated by skin care products. With acne rosacea, the skin tissue becomes more susceptible to irritations from damaged nerve endings or an excess of neurotransmitters. As the condition worsens, the skin can no longer protect the nerve endings adequately. Even though a healthy immune system and repeated moisturizing will help to minimize these effects, some additional steps may still need to be taken. People who suffer from acne rosacea should avoid using products that will dry out the skin, such as alcohol. Instead they should try a solution such as Proactive or other similar alcohol-free cleansers. Other products such as Clearasil or Oxy-5 contain the ingredients benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, which are known to be agents that fight off acne. If in combination with any other products, such as retinoid, users should discontinue the topical application of products, as it may further dry out and irritate the skin. It is also important to remember to be gentler when washing your face. Acne rosacea patients should not think that scrubbing harder is going to be any better. It is also important not to wash and clean the face an excessive amount of times. It is basically about using a gently exfoliating product, such as Proactive or Nuetrogena, and taking the care to do it right. Acne rosacea patients should use gentle cleansing products and also protect their sensitive skin with a dye-free moisturizer containing petrolatum, glycerin, or aloe vera. All of these ingredients have anti-inflammatory properties, which will help keep the skin moisturized and protected. Applying a light coat of this to the affected area before going outdoors, particularly in the sun, will help minimize acne outbreaks. Acne rosacea can stay with a person, especially men, for their entire lives. But it doesn’t necessarily have to. It does go away naturally in many cases, so in the meantime; take a little care to keep it at a minimum.

As the most common disease in the world, it is often taken for granted that spots, blackheads and greasy skin will stake their temporary claim on the faces of almost everyone in the world. However, for approximately 15% of people, these spots will persist, or be widespread and scarring. With surprisingly poor, inadequate information available to teenagers about acne management, many do not even realise the pharmacy assistant and pharmacist are able to provide help. How much do you really know about acne and its causes? Do you know that there is no proven link with diet and acne? Did you realise that not everyone grows out of having acne, with 5% of women and 1% of men in their 40's still suffering from a 'teenage' problem? What are the Common Acne Myths? The starting point of correct acne management should start from clearing up the myths 1. Acne is caused by food. Scientific studies have not found a link between diet and acne. Prisoners in the United States were enrolled on a trial to determine whether chocolate had a direct effect upon the sebaceous glands. At the end of the trial, it was concluded that acne was not affected by chocolate consumption. However, it is always sensible to advise a healthy, balanced diet, whilst reassuring that food will not affect acne. 2. Acne is contagious. Doctors have studied the effect of extracting pus from one spot and injecting it directly into unaffected skin. This experiment concluded that it did not spread spots. 3. Acne is caused by dirt. Spots are caused by activity beneath the skin and therefore surface dirt will play only a small role in the formation of acne. People think that the black in a blackhead is caused by dirt, but it is the skin's natural melanin, which turns black once it comes into contact with the air. Some people will even claim that over-washing can cause acne, but this may be hard to prove. 4. Acne is caused by too many hormones. Hormones have a large role to play in the formation of acne, but it is easy to misunderstand this as the body producing too many hormones. In one acne clinic held at a top Leeds centre for acne research, all patients attending that day's clinic were asked to provide a blood sample, which was later analysed for hormone levels. There was no significant increase in male hormones in these patients, which suggested that it is therefore sensitivity to male hormones present in normal levels in the skin that is to blame. 5. Everyone grows out of acne. Acne usually has a four to eight year timeline from start to finish. If you get it when you are 12 you should se the end of it between 16 and 20. The average age range for acne is 14 to 22. However Acne can persist into adulthood and 8% of acne sufferers are over 40 It is rare to have acne for a lifetime, but some people will not grow out of their acne. Research from Leeds University suggests that acne lasts on average for eight years. 6. Acne and spots are not same. Many people will try to distinguish between acne and spots. In fact, acne is just the medical name doctors give for spots. However, someone with the occasional, mild spot would not be described as having clinical acne. Approximately 15% of all people who have 'spots' will require further help from a doctor to treat their skin. 7. Stress causes acne. The ordinary stress in day to day living is not an important factor in acne. Only situations of extreme stress, such as divorce, exams or death of a close family member may induce acne or make existing acne worse; however this is not common and will usually respond well to usual acne treatments.

However it is possible to have this common condition at any time in your life, and many people are plagued by acne throughout their adult lives, and find themselves in an endless search for a drug or product which will end their problem for ever. Acne itself is a condition caused by excess oil in the skin, and this oil breaks down into fatty acids which cause the skin to inflame. This normally takes place on the face and neck, but can also create more serious scars in addition to the common spots and pimples. There are many natural and alternative acne treatments available in preference to the conventional chemical acne creams and lotions. Although not technically an alternative acne treatment, as a first step it is advisable to analyze your diet as this can often contribute significantly to the condition. Avoiding processed and prepackaged food is advisable for all of us, regardless of any skin conditions, but an unprocessed food diet should be particularly beneficial for those suffering from acne. Fried and fatty oily food and food cooked in vegetable oils will contribute to the oils which cause acne, but healthy oils such as those contained in fish such as sardines can be consumed, these are known as Omega 3 oils. A healthy diet will also improve how your body processes food and integral to this is drinking lots of water. Most of us do not drink enough water, only getting part of our necessary intake though the water contained in other products and beverages. Drinking water, up to 10 glasses a day or more, will help to cleanse your system of many of the oils and toxins which may contribute to acne. Another alternative acne treatment with potential benefits is increasing your vitamin intake. This can be done by buying vitamin tablets and supplements, but care must be taken as high levels of vitamins in the body can also be harmful. Vitamin A supplements can help with acne but as with all supplements they should be taken in moderation and preferably in consultation with your doctor. Similarly Zinc is often seen as an aid to alleviating acne symptoms, as it can help inflammation reduction and helps the immune system which protects against infection. Zinc can be found in foods such as liver eggs and seafood in particular. There are other products created from herbs which are reportedly able to help acne sufferers. Overall the best advice to those afflicted by acne who want to avoid conventional chemical treatments is to start with a healthy diet, and give this new regime a chance to work. Locate one of the many sites or books outlining a healthy eating plan concentrating on those foods which contain little fatty vegetable oils and significant omega 3 oils, and critically drink lots of water. This simple change may be enough to alleviate many of your acne symptoms. "},{"title":" Alternative Acne Treatments – A Brief Users Guide For Parents, Teens And The Rest Of Us.

The two main reasons for the growing popularity of such treatments are; people looking for medication with less harmful side effects then tradition acne treatments.

Generally alternative treatments are not regulated by the FDA and hence you will not receive much guidance from medical doctors on their use. Word of month and the alternative medical community is the main source of information on such options. For teenage girls and women herbs that balance hormone levels such as chaste berry, black cohosh, dong quai, evening primrose, wild yam, and red clover are quite commonly tried. Herbalists believe that these herbs balance the female sex hormone estrogen and will counterbalance the hormone androgen. Since androgen is believed to trigger excess sebrum production, which can cause hair follicles to clog and acne to form, acne could be prevented or reduced. Herbs that are thought to help reduce inflammation and infection can be used for both male and female acne suffers. Echinacea, licorice, dandelion root, and burdock are all thought to contain properties that help with the above by killing bacteria. The herbs salvia and red peony are also used sometimes to help acne suffers improve their skins ability to heal. Vitamin B5 also known as pantothenic acid is a commonly used vitamin to treat acne. It become widely popular after Dr. Leung a Hong Kong acne expert published a paper on its effectiveness. His paper was based on the theory that acne sufferers are deficient in vitamin B. The result is excess sebum production, the root cause of clogged hair follicles leading to acne. Dr Leung also tested his theory through a clinical trial where 100 acne suffers were given 10g of B5 daily, after six months Dr. Leung’s test group had a ninety percent success rate. Topical treatments such as tea tree oil and seaweed, which are both believed to have powerful antibacterial properties are also widely regarded as being effective on acne inflammations. Tea tree oil comes from the ti tree in Australia and seaweed from the oceans. A common belief is that controlling stress reduces the severity of acne. So anything you can do to alleviate stress will help. Many acne suffers turn to exercise for stress relief, yoga being very popular. Aromatherapy can also be used in stress relief, along with acupuncture, and meditation. While the predominate reason many people turn to alternative acne treatments is to reduce the harmful side effects of tradition medicines the reverse may actually be true. Caution should be used before trying any alternative treatments. They may have adverse side effects not common known due to the lack of regulations on most alternative treatments.

Dermatologists suggest that you should avoid the use astringents unless your skin is extremely oily. If you feel an astringent is a necessary part of your skin care regiment, use ONLY on oily areas. If you have a problem with oily hair, it is helpful to wash it daily. It is strongly recommended that those with acne avoid frequent exposure to the sun and visits to a tanning salon. It may seem as though these two activities are helpful when practicing proper skin care, but that is untrue. The results of each are temporary. Sunburn or tanned skin only help to hide an acne problem. Do NOT squeeze or \"pop\" skin blemishes. This can cause permanent scaring and the appearance of dark splotches, on the skin. (Not something you want have for the rest of your life.) Men who have acne should use care when shaving. Either an electric or safety razor can be used. Those who choose a safety razor should always use a sharp blade and soften their beard with soap and water, before applying shaving cream. It won't happen overnight, but as long as you are consistent, you will start to see an improvement. If you have acne, proper skin care is the first step to controlling the problem.

","keywords":" acne, herbal, footbath, hand bath, eliminate, skin ","article_body":" n a book I read by William L. Fischer called Hidden Secrets of Super Perfect Health at Any Age, Book II, 1986, I learn how to do herbal footbaths. In chapter 10, The F-M Circulizer System, Fischer discusses the use of an herbal footbath. After reading this chapter, I realized how herbs in a footbath could improve your skin and help you eliminate acne. This book was written in 1986 and Fischer claims herbal footbaths have been in use overseas since 1946! Now, you can do either a footbath or a hand bath.  Once you prepare a container with hot water you can put your feet or hands into it and get the same results. If you already have foot spa, thank your mother, sister, or whoever bought it because you’re in for a treat.  If you don’t, with $20 or $30 you can get one just like I did. When you use a heated footbath, veins in your feet start to expand. Over a period of 15-20 minute, the warm water affects your entire vascular (blood) system and you get improved blood circulation. By adding an herbal infusion into the hot water in the footbath, minerals and other phytochemicals from the herbs enter the soles of your feet and into your blood stream. This means that you can introduce herbal phytochemicals into your blood stream using the footbath. During your footbath, these herbal chemicals quickly circulated throughout your body and get to work neutralizing acid, killing bacteria, and improving your skin circulation. Here is an herbal combination you can use.  This herbal combination was taken and modified slightly from a book written by Daniel B. Mowrey, Ph.D., called The Scientific Validation of Herbal Medicine, 1986.  Mowrey says, “This (herbal) blend attacks external skin disorders from within, purifying the blood, carrying away waste, reinforcing the blood’s ability to ward off infectious agents.” The herbal combination to use is, *  Dandelion root – purifies blood and improves liver function *  Yellow dock root – purifies blood, helps liver, is anti-bacterial *  Saraparilla root – has antibiotic action, promotes waste elimination through urine and sweating *  Echinacea – increases immunity and promotes skin healing *  Licorice – protects the liver so that it can detoxify the blood better *  Kelp – provide minerals and vitamins and binds heavy metal that are bad for health *  Chaparral – is anti-microbial making effective against acne. *  Fresh Garlic – cut up a few cubes of garlic and place them into the hot water.   Garlic is has antibacterial properties. Buy one ounce of each herb and mix them. Here’s how to do the herbal footbath, *  Place 2-3 tablespoons of herbal mix into 1 ½ cups of water *  Boil the water with herbs – use only a glass, porcelain, or stainless steel container *  After water starts to boil, pull the container off the stove *  Let tea sit for 15-30 minutes.  The longer the tea sits the stronger the tea and its effects *  Prepare your foot spa with water *  Strain the tea to remove leaves and roots *  Poor tea and cut garlic into the foot spa *  Place your feet or hands in the hot water for 15 – 30 minutes.

Importantly, acne can become infected if ignored, creating scars, and pockmarks that become permanent blemishes on your face. I don't want this to happen to you, so I’ve detailed some excellent treatments on the website below… Acne is a disease called seborrhea or seborrheic dermatitis. Acne occurs when the sebaceous glands, under your skin, become contaminated with either of the following •\tDirt •\tDead skin •\tExcess sebum oil •\tAcid waste •\tBacteria •\tToxic matter Under normal circumstances, the sebaceous glands release oil that is excreted through your pores onto the skin surface. This release of oil helps to keep your skin moist and lubricated, protecting your skin from the environment. If the pores on your face are blocked, this creates toxic oil that cannot be excreted from your skin. This results in inflammation, a pimple or a spot, as the more toxic oil tries to reach the surface of your skin. If the pore walls burst under the skin, white blood cells move in to digest the collagen around the pores. And this happens; scars can be caused on your face. To avoid scars, an acne-cleansing program is recommended, and this should begin before you get acne or as soon as acne appears. You must prevent your pimples and blackheads getting to the point where they get severely infected and burst. Acne is an extremely complex condition, involving many parts of the body, usually only appearing on the face and elsewhere on your skin. Acne is a sign that you have problems elsewhere within your body and can be caused by a toxic colon, poor digestion of food, weak liver and other conditions that cause the blood to carry too much toxicity. To clear acne, it is not always possible to try one treatment and expect the acne problem to be solved. However, it may be possible to use a special cream and have your acne diminish or clear within days – it depends on the type of acne and the severity of your acne as to which acne treatments will work best for you.

Although the worries and cares of adulthood are still far into the future, the teen is not exactly a happy and relaxed person. The carelessness and ignorance of childhood makes room for rebellion and questions about one’s values and place in the world. Looking for their own road through life teens feel insecure and, often enough, misunderstood. Unfortunately, if the search for a place under the sun is not enough, teenagers also have to deal with other problems, such as acne. This unsightly condition is the bane of many teenagers because of the effects it has at psychological level. It doesn’t take a lot to foster a negative self image in a teenager. Most of them are at least somewhat insecure about their outward appearance because of various real or imaginary blemishes. But a real condition that causes true discomfort and mars a young face is something else altogether. The fragile self image and self respect of teenagers are hard pressed to cope with the pressure exerted by the opinions of others and the comparisons with various role-models that teenagers find for themselves. In extreme cases, the negative self image turns into self hatred and the disfiguring condition is seen as a cruel instrument of self punishment for failing to rise up to some standard or other. Teenagers live in small worlds. Parents, friends and the amorphous group of half-familiar school mates are the limits of their social lives. Naturally, teenagers tend to attach more importance to the praise or criticism coming from their friends or school mates, on grounds that parents love you anyway and are fatally biased. But, since teens can be very cruel to each other, the criticism of school mates is frequently unkind and meant to hurt. This serves to increase the feelings of anxiety, insecurity and self hatred, resulting in withdrawal from the social environment into a private world of pain and shame. Teenagers are terribly earnest about outward appearances and criticism. They are still away from the age when human beings come to terms with themselves and are no longer much interested in what others say or think. Hiding one’s body or face and feeling ashamed just because somebody else said that this is the thing to do is a mistake and teenagers should be helped to see this. Acne can be defeated with persistence and by using the right products. However, the psychological effects of acne must also be fought, or else they may never go away. The teenager who hated himself for having pimples on his face will turn into the adult who hates himself for being a little overweight or not making as much money as some co-worker. The feeling of discomfort and shame with oneself does not always go away in time. Sometimes it just finds a new problem to act as its power source. This is the lasting effect of acne a poor self image, a lack of confidence and a feeling of being at a disadvantage when comparing oneself to other people. These moods and mindsets can ruin anybody’s social life and often they also get in the way of professional development. Unfortunately, acne is not just skin deep.

These “natural” remedies are usually natural items such as everyday foods, plants, chemicals, etc.  The claim is that certain combinations of these ingredients act in such a way that the effect will reduce acne. Before you run off and do these items, there are other things you should check into.  Although doctors and scientists cannot say for sure what exactly causes acne, there are several things that are at the top of the list of suspects. Medications - Many believe that Acne can be a side effect of some drugs, including barbiturates, seizure medication and steroids.  Interestingly enough some believe that birth control pills cause acne while others prescribe birth-control as a medication for acne. Chocolate - Many now believe that chocolate cannot cause acne outbreaks.  Still, there are those who are staunch believers that chocolate causes outbreaks.  The debate rages on. Stress - While stress may not be a cause of acne, many people believe that stress can aggravate acne.  Exercise is a great way to relieve stress. Washing your face too often - While acne sufferers should keep their face clean, too much washing or harsh scrubbing will actually aggravate the skin causing acne to occur Using greasy skin care products and oily cosmetics.  Acne occurs when the pores become plugged up.  Therefore, one can assume that any product that covers up the face in anyway may block the pores and the natural release of sebum may help cause acne flare-ups. Environmental Irritants  - Think of it, pollution is an unnatural containment.  Being in a high pollution area can cause several reactions in the body, including acne.  It is also thought that high humidity can cause acne outbreaks.  High humidity can cause the skin to swell thereby blocking those pores. Your Diet - Your diet, (what you eat) can have significant impact on acne outbreaks. Excessive dairy products, fatty foods, etc. are thought to have an impact on acne breakouts as well as a lack of zinc in your diet.  Zinc supplements are often prescribed to treat acne. As always, each person is different.  You may have noticed that certain foods seem to have more of an impact on your acne than others.  If you are unsure, pay closer attention to your diet and keep track of your acne outbreaks. Of course, you should always consult with your dermatologist/doctor.

Some argue that diet is not directly connected to breakouts, but I am convinced that it is one of the causes of adult acne. My face breaks out if I eat junk food and if I do not drink enough water. This usually occurs over a course of a few days and in combination. The latter is more significant as one of the causes of adult acne because I have gotten away with snacking on junk food without breakouts if I drank enough water. Men also show signs that there is a chemical imbalance that needs to be considered in the search for the causes of adult acne. Hair loss is tell-tale sign that significant changes are occurring in a man’s system. Women are not exempt from the worries of hair loss, either. If you are having both hair loss and breakouts, you may want to consult with a doctor who can tell you if there is a connection. Keeping track of your mood and your diet can help you discover the causes of adult acne. Sometimes we need to listen to our bodies. It may take a little time and effort, but you may be surprised that the causes of adult acne are really manageable. One way to tell if hormones are at play is to consider other signs of an imbalance. For example, hormones may factor in as causes for adult acne if they appear along with a severe case of premenstrual syndrome. There is no such thing as a case of PMS that is not severe, at least according to my husband. You may be able to address both the PMS problems and the blemish problems at once. This could lead to a very happy, pimple-free home. Many mature people remember the days when blemishes and pimples were significant sources of anxiety.

Puberty is a time of hormonal disarray and epidermal awakenings. However, many adults are faced with the adolescent curse. In order for mature individuals to treat breakouts, it is necessary to explore the causes of adult acne. There are a few things to consider when breakouts are no longer part of a rite of passage. The causes of adult acne do not necessarily revolve around a person’s facial cleaning regimen. Just because you cleanse your face does not mean that you will be blemish-free. The breakouts are usually a message that causes for adult acne are working internally. You internal workings are literally worn on your face.

Will frequent face washing eliminate acne? A. Although a popular belief, dirty skin does not cause acne, and frequent face washing and scrubbing can actually make acne worse. Q. Is acne caused by poor nutritional choices? A. Scientific studies have not found a clear link between diet and acne. In other words, chocolate or greasy foods do not cause or worsen acne in most people. If acne is being treated appropriately, there's no need to worry about certain foods leading to a breakout. Q. Will squeezing pimples make them go away quicker? A. No. It is recommended that those with acne avoid squeezing, pinching or picking at the face. Any sort of skin friction created by rubbing or leaning can actually make acne worse. Q. Is acne just part of adolescence? A. Although many teens are affected by acne, it is important to know that acne may be improved with proper treatment. Teens with acne should see a family doctor or dermatologist for the appropriate treatment. Acne that is not treated may lead to permanent physical scars, which can affect how people feel about themselves. Q. Are all acne medications the same? A. No. There is a wide range of over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications that can be used to help treat acne. Some medications help reduce the buildup of too much oil and fight bacteria associated with pimples; other medications help unclog the pores.

Arguably the best aspect of these B Vitamins is that there are so many, they are almost always taken in conjunction, and they have so many uses in the body besides fighting acne and keeping skin nice and clean. Here is a breakdown of the B Vitamins Thiamine (Vitamin B1) -- Thiamine is an antioxidant and it helps to rid the body, and the skin, of toxins and free radicals, therefore helping to keep the skin clear and acne free. It also enhances circulation and helps with digestion. Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) -- Riboflavin is essential for maintaining healthy skin, hair, and nails. It helps to strengthen and repair the skin and helps to prevent acne from forming. In addition, Riboflavin also works with Vitamin A to promote a healthy digestive tract. Niacinamide (Vitamin B3) -- Niacinamide is essential for maintaining healthy skin and helps to improve circulation. It helps to prevent acne from forming and spreading. It also helps the metabolism break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Pantothenic Acid (Vitamin B5) -- Pantothenic acid greatly helps in reducing stress. Stress is a leading cause of acne breakouts and pantothenic acid can help to keep it under control. It is also needed for proper functioning of the adrenal glands. Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) -- Pyridoxine is extremely important in the functioning of the immune system and of antibody production. It also helps to fight acne. Cobalamin (Vitamin B12) -- Works in conjunction with other vitamins and enhances their effects and helps them to better maintain healthy, clear skin. On its own, also helps to increase energy and helps to maintain healthy nerve cells. A vitamin deficiency in many of these alone can lead to breakouts of acne.

And just like the acne that appears on other parts of the body, when the sebaceous gland gets clogged, dead skin cells become trapped inside the hair follicles and soon, bacteria is on its way, inflaming the tissues surrounding the affected areas and causing acne. Any type of acne can appear on the back including whiteheads and blackheads, pustules (the surface type), papules (a bit deeper) or the acne can form deep in the skin and cause acne cysts. Back acne doesn't seem to be triggered by hereditary, stress or a poor diet, but long hair has been known to aggravate the pores on the back. If you have long hair and back acne, you might want to keep your hair off your back. <b>Back Acne Treatments</b> The skin that covers the back is much thicker than the skin that covers the other parts of the body where acne is prone to appear. And because of this difference in skin thickness, the treatment regime for 'bacne' is going to be different. It's still very important to keep the back clean and the best way is to bathe or shower frequently, especially after working out. Use a cleanser that contains salicylic or glycolic acid. If you've never used one before, now is the time to learn how to gently use a loofah so you can begin removing those dead skin cells (also known as exfoliating). After washing and drying the skin, apply a topical product that contains benzoyl peroxide to the areas on the back that are affected by acne and be sure to allow the product to fully absorb into the skin (it can stain clothing). Also, it's important to only treat the areas that have acne, rather than slathering the product all over the back. You don't want the skin on your back to become excessively dry. If you dry out the skin, you'll have to moisturize and that could cause more acne. If you cannot reach the affected areas, have someone apply the product for you. That's all you really need to treat back acne. Most people don't wash their backs as well as they should so changing this bad habit will produce almost immediate results. Of course if your back acne is severe, you should consult with a dermatologist.

","keywords":" acne ","article_body":" Many people think they know what causes acne, the inflammation of skin pores that results in problems such as blackheads, whiteheads or pimples, primarily in teenagers.  There are a lot of misconceptions about acne though.  Officially common acne is known as acne vulgaris.  And in explaining it, the answer becomes bit complicated. Acne is an inflamed disease of the skin, and it has many causes, one of which is bacteria in the pores of the skin.  The body in many ways becomes allergic to this type of bacteria.  This attracts while blood cells to fight the allergy, and the pores become blocked.  Oil secretions will build up and provide a breeding ground for even more bacteria. Then pimples will form.  These red bumps resemble small boils, which fill with a nasty puss caused by the body fighting the infection of the bacteria. There is probably no perfect cure for acne other than outgrowing it but there are a number nothing that can be done to lessen the physical effects. First, remember that for many years, people thought that acne was caused by poor hygiene and by eating certain foods.  Fried foods and chocolate were especially blamed for acne, probably because teenagers eat fried foods and chocolate commonly, but that may have been blaming the messenger for the message. There is no scientific evidence linking diet to acne. Also, while personal hygiene is important and a good thing, over washing can damage skin and actually make acne worse.  But good hygiene and a good diet can't hurt, and they might just help a little.  Also using makeup that doesn't clog pores but can at least assist the body in not making acne worse. Treatments that kill the bacteria that cause acne included the use of antibiotics like tetracycline, doxycycline and minocyclne, which are taken orally.  Also topical antibiotics or bactericides like Benzoyl peroxide or erythromycin can help.  The bacteria also known as \"P. acnes\", does however become resistant to the antibiotics eventually.  However Benzoyl peroxide, an oxidizer, does not seem to generate resistance by the bacteria.  While the acne will come back, it is a short term and temporary cure and is applied topically. Exfoliating the skin can also help. This method can be done by using a cloth or a liquid scrub, or by using certain chemicals.  Chemical exfoliating substances include salicylic acid and glycolic acid.  Both of these agents cause a peeling of the top layer of skin, which prevents a build up of dead skin which blocks pores when combined with oil. This in turn, makes a breeding ground for bacteria. Another over the counter remedy is salicylic acid, which softens skin and gets rid of dead skin cells, which in turn unclogs pores.  Many face wash products contain this ingredient.  Also sulfur contained in many over the counter products works well for many people.  Another product is glycolic acid, which is found in anti-aging products as well as acne medicines. There are also a number of natural remedies that can fight acne and the bacteria that causes it. Tea tree oil is gaining in popularity.  It kills the bacteria and also reduces redness and inflammation.  It works much the same as Benzoyl peroxide but causes less skin irritation and is carried at health food stories. Acupuncture is used by some and is thought to alleviate hormonal imbalances n the body.  Those who use acupuncture also usually suggest lifestyle changes and a change n diet, including cutting back on dairy products. Light therapy is another natural remedy to fight the bacteria that has many adherents.  Many people believe that the bacteria that causes acne insensitive to light in the blue wavelength of the light spectrum.  Light therapy means shining blue light onto a patient for fifteen minutes at a time twice a week, usually for four weeks.  This treatment can be expenses, running about $150 per treatment.  Not all patients have had good results, but some have.  Also since light in this wavelength is not harmful to the skin, there are no side effects or after effects. Fighting the bacteria that causes acne is of major concern for many medical professionals, and surely with time they will find more and better ways to do so.  In the meantime, the treatments listed here can help many people. "},{"title":" Be Proactive With Acne Treatment ","word_count":406,"summary":" At some point in life, most people deal with acne.

I am convinced that one of the reasons that so many people are unhappy with their chosen method of acne treatment is that they haven't taken the time to make changes to their lifestyle. I am a firm believer that the most effective acne treatment is one that requires a total change of lifestyle. When any client struggling with acne enters my office, my first assignemnt to them is to change some of their lifestyle habits for a month and then return to see me. I will not prescribe any topical or oral acne treatment until people have other daily habits under control. For example, I look carefully at the typical diet of my patients and I look for ways to help them cut out junk food. I ask them to drink more water and less beverages that are filled with sugar, and I encourage them to stay away from sugary and salty foods for the month. I monitor their fitness habits and suggest that they get moving. This might seem like a strange method of acne treatment, but you would be shocked to learn that every single client of mine returns to my office after a month of changing their lifestyle in awe of what a difference changing habits has made for them.

","keywords":" acne benzoyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide product, benzoyl peroxide, acne review treatment ","article_body":" One of the problems with benzoyl peroxide topical acne treatments is that they can be quite irritating, particularly to sensitive skin. Those fans of benzoyl peroxide will thus be pleased to learn that one skin care company that supplies prescription acne and skin care products is releasing a treatment with a delivery system that reduces benzoyl peroxide's irritating effect. Called NeoBenz Micro, this acne treatment will be available only by prescription, which is one drawback. On the plus side, it should mean that the acne sufferer is given the appropriate strength to their particular needs. It is aimed at helping people with mild to moderate acne, and comes in three strengths. These are 3.5% benzoyl peroxide, 5.5% benzoyl peroxide, and 8.5% benzoyl peroxide. The difference in this treatment as compared to regular benzoyl peroxide solutions, is that it is a time release product. The method designed by SkinMedica, NeoBenz Micro's developer, uses very small 'sponges', called microsponges. These hold the active ingredient, in this case benzoyl peroxide, to be slowly released throughout the day. It means that though acne is kept in contact with benzoyl peroxide for the whole day, only small amounts of it are released onto the skin. These amounts are enough to be effective but far less irritating. The side effects that this benzoyl peroxide acne treatment aims at reducing are rashes, skin soreness, and irritation. Aside from the unpleasant feeling these effects create, they unfortunately also reduce the effectiveness of benzoyl peroxide in clearing acne. NeoBenz Micro is one example of a new trend in the pharmaceutical industry. It aims at taking existing products and developing new ways to package and deliver the active ingredients, thus effectively modernizing many treatments. The emphasis in the past had been more research oriented - finding new and more powerful treatments rather than fine tuning existing ones that were proven to work. Other examples of this phenomena include converting treatments into sprays, with the effect of increasing absorption and convenience. MedPharm, a research contracting firm, is turning one eczema treatment and two acne treatments into sprays. These are still in the development stage, however.

It’s a nagging skin ailment that we commonly call pimples, blackheads, whiteheads, red or yellow spots, cystic nodules or scars. The acne prone age is between 12 and 25 years. But beware; it’s not just a teen trouble. Even in your 30s and 40s you may get acne attacks. Acne can cause lifelong scars, if left untreated. Hence, it is vital to be proactive about acne treatment, beginning right from home remedies. Acne treatment essentially involves the use of both preventive and curative products. Preventive products The natural way to keep off acne begins at home. If you wish to keep off acne, follow this home treatment attentively and be sure of great results. - Keep your face spotless clean, by washing it often with a gentle anti-bacterial cleanser or some home-made natural product - Never use greasy, oil-based moisturizers - Never use products containing synthetic chemicals and vegetable oils - Keep your hair off your face - Never dig or touch scars - Keep skin pores unclogged with products containing sulfur plus resorcinol However, pregnant women, kids and patients under some other medication, should consult a doc before they use such products. Medication methods The condition of your acne will determine the treatment options. Treatment also depends on the oil balance of your skin, your gender and your existing medications. The most proactive acne treatment is with topical products (gels, creams) containing Salicylic acid, Benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, tetracycline, erythromycin or a retinoid. Many times a combination of these products also works well. Physicians also prescribe oral medications like antibiotics, hormones, and isotretinoins. Go for such acne treatment only after knowing the side effects. Laser treatment Laser treatment has completely cured many. Here the laser destroys the excess oil producing glands and removes scars. It is painless, harmless but costly. However, to get rid of the existing acne you need medication. Cystic treatment Acute cystic acne needs cystic treatments with Accutane or isotretinoin. But, there are side effects. Since most other treatments are not effective on cystic acne, these severe products are unavoidable.   Chinese treatments The Chinese method is a natural herbal acne treatment. They believe in getting to the root of the problem like liver ailments, emotional upsets, wind heat, damp heat, blood heat etc. “They even trace acne to reasons like a stagnant qi (energy). Their natural products do help many,” says dermatologist Dr Manela Humphrey.  Peel power TCA Peels are an easy, safe and affordable acne treatment. “They are also more effective than other clinic or spa-based treatments,” says salon specialist Mary Roberts. Peels were earlier available only through costly treatments by skin specialists, at US$ 500- 1000 per session. These same peels are now easily available at less than US$30.

Now back to the best acne treatments – the professional choices. There are several products which a person can consider as the best acne treatment. However, the best acne treatment for an individual could not be the ideal one for another person. This is due to the fact that the skin type of each individual differs from the other. And the best acne treatment is determined by the type of skin a person has and the skin reaction on that treatment. The best acne treatment could also range from the traditional herbal acne remedies to the modern medicines like acne light treatment which are proved to offer better results. Before determining which is the best acne treatment one needs to assess the level of toxicity in the acne treatment product. Low level of toxicity means there is less health risk involved in it.

","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" There are several criteria for acne treatments for teenagers. Number one - they must have a high rate of success. Two, they should be simple to use. And number three, they must be safe for your skin, preferably good for sensitive skin. Preferably, they should also be fast acting. And low cost. Teens and parents should not have to spend hundreds on dermatologists and facial peels. There are two systems that I think qualify for serious consideration for those seeking acne treatments for teenagers. The first was created by a Board Cerified Plastic and Reconstructive surgeon, Dr Beckman. He has a background in chemistry as well as 24 years of experience in plastic surgery, where he developed expertise in the principles of skin restoration. He has developed a two step system, which is by its nature simple to follow. The first step is an antimicrobial wash that gets rid of 99.9% of all bacteria on the skin's surface for up to 12 hours. This reduces the chance for infection to occur, and many people using his system have found that even if they were on oral antibiotics or accutane that this alone was able to help prevent future acne outbreaks. This cleanser is also excellent for removing dirt and oily deposits on the skin. The next step is a topical medication designed to encourage the skin's natural process of exfoliation. This treatment contains salicylic acid and lactic acid, which remove dead skin cells and oily plugs from the sebaceous glands to prevent acne by unclogging pores. Lactic acid encourages the growth of new collagen and elastin, whilst restoring the skin's natural PH balance. This acne treatments for teenagers system has been used by people with all types of acne - from mild to severe cystic acne. It is 100% effecive on people with Grades 1 & 2 acne, 80-90% successful with Grades 3 acne, and very effective in controlling new breakouts with Grade 4 acne sufferers. Users on prescription medications like accutane were able to cut back on their dosage or stop using it altogether. In a study of high school and college students over 12 weeks, all participants had some degree of improvement, and most improvements were within a two week period. So the Reversion system is fast acting. Grades 1 & 2 acne sufferers achieved total control of their acne, and Grades 3 & 4 achieved dramatic improvements. Click Here to Buy or Find out more about Reversion's acne treatments for teenagers The next system of acne treatments for teenagers that I recommend is by Zen Med. Theirs is a 3 step system, with a little bit of a different approach to Reversion. They have two topical applications like Reversion, a cleanser and an acne treatment medication. But they also have herbal acne supplements included in the package. This is an important part of the treatment, and one of the reasons they have such a high success rate with many people's acne clearing up for good. The Zen Med system was developed using the 3000 year plus expertise of Traditional Chinese Medicine, combined with modern therapeutics. Theirs is an all natural, all herbal preparation that works on mild to severe acne. It does not contain drugs and there are no side effects. Many people who tried traditional prescription medication but did not achieve satisfactory results on these were very happy with what the Zen Med system did for their skin. One of the big pluses in this acne treatments for teenagers is that most people using it stopped their acne at the source within 1 to 3 months - this is not a treatment that you will have to be using for the rest of your life.

For individuals still in their teens, I would recommend that you check and see what is going on in your life right now, and see what may be different or has changed prior to you having your problem skin! I know most of you may think that it’s all part of nature, or it’s part of your family genetics, and you would like to find that miracle cure! However, the true problem may exist because of your lifestyle choices, and until you fully understand why you’re currently experiencing severe blemish breakouts, or increased blackheads in your pores, you can then follow the cycle of your consistent outbreaks that cause you to feel helpless in your battle. It’s a fact that our society is placing more pressures on students, and many working individuals. Schools are placing more study loads on the student, and the business industry is downsizing, causing more hours to be placed on the employees! What this does to your body and your mind is that it places an incredible load of stress on you, as well as the affects, which can easily change your daily lifestyle. <b>You may be asking, how does this all come into play with my acne condition, and how do I connect these facts to my acne treatment? </b> There are many studies out today indicating that “stress” and the way you take care of your body, and the products you may be using are a contributing factor to your pimples and blackheads.  If you can look back when you had good skin and see what you may have been doing differently, you could hopefully make some lifestyle changes for the better. With these changes, you could possibly see positive results, and avoid having to take acne medications prescribed by your dermatologist. There are many elements that can be contributing to your skin blemishes, and the ingredients in the select treatment product you’re using can also be the cause of your skin irritation, which is causing your reoccurring pimple breakouts. So let’s look at some topics that have come up in some studies, and see if we can clarify some of the elements that may be affecting your current lifestyle. <b>Facial Medications, Caffeine, Stress, And The Sun! What Do They Have In Common, And How Does It Affect Your Blemish Situation? </b> I’m not a doctor, and I don’t have any professional skin care background, but what I do have is a common sense approach to issues. When I read about certain acne products, and also the food and drink we consume on a daily basis, plus the type of life we live makes sense to me when we mix it all together and try and link it to our skin condition. First we should talk about coffee, pop and alcohol, and see what the connection is to skin problems. In my opinion, the way I interpret coffee, pop and alcohol is that they contribute several elements to your body that assist in major changes to your skin. Caffeine and sugar in coffee and pop, plus alcohols are partial diuretics that assist in drawing more water out of your body than bringing water back in, plus they’re a stimulant and can prevent you from getting the recommended amount of sleep that your body needs, which ranges from at least 7 to 8 hours per night. What this all means is that by consuming these products daily, they could be changing the entire dynamics of your body, and affecting you dramatically without you even realizing the changes. What happens is this your body may become over stimulated with all these items going through your system, and either consumed separately or in combination, your skin may seriously become affected by these products. Depending on your body’s tolerance level, your reactions could be reflected by the daily consumption. Let’s look at the connection of the cleansers, creams, and acne cosmetics you’re currently using, and see why some may not work to prevent your acne breakouts or increased blackheads. When taking a common sense approach to the ingredients, avoid any product that will shrink your pores! Now this information may contradict products that say they reduce pore size, and make them look less visible. What that means I don’t know. But when you think about it for a moment, if you have a product that shrinks your pores, that’s going to increase the chance that you will have more oil trapped in your skin. The more of the skin’s oil that is potentially blocking your pores, the higher chance you’re going to form blackheads and whiteheads, plus the trapped oil will be tasty food for bacteria that feeds off the oil and dead skin, eventually turning it into a nasty blemish. Think about that, and if it makes sense to you, then avoid products that have any astringent agents in them. The sun is one that I have been very confused about for a long time, but again when it was explained to me, it made total sense, and now I really understand the benefits and the damages it can cause. The sun actually can help you in your battle on acne; however, the time you spend in the sun can make the big difference. I found out that the sun actually aids in killing bacteria on your skin, but you should limit your time to approximately 15 minutes per day, because when you spend long periods of time in the sun, it will eventually dry and reduce the pores in your skin. Now like above, what happens when the pores shrink? Absolutely, trapped oil and the formation of zits! Stress, in my opinion, is the biggest contributor to your body’s lifestyle changes, and believe it or not, it seems to tie in with everything above, because stress is caused by many elements from the types of food you consume, to the everyday lifestyle you lead with your work and play. Again, I’m not a doctor, but even with my own body I notice that if I don’t get enough sleep, or I worry about a project that has to be completed, and the everyday choices I make in cleaning my skin all is in some way a contributor to stress, and the changes in my body. So when you sit back and see if you can adjust anything in the way you live your life for the better, you may be on the right track to not only a healthier lifestyle, but also clearer, blemish free skin!

While washing your face is an important part of personal hygiene, it may do little to actually eliminate acne production. Facial cleansing is a topical approach, while acne is produced in a different way. “Acne is a disorder resulting from the action of hormones and other substances on the skin’s oil glands and hair follicles. These factors lead to plugged pores and outbreaks of lesions commonly called pimples or zits.” (Department of Health and Human Services) The Department of H.H.S. also admits, “Although acne is usually not a serious health threat, it can be a source of significant emotional distress.” Source Questions and Answers About…Acne) When you struggle with acne you are very aware of the emotional distress it can cause in both personal opinions and social situations. The truth is acne is a normal part of adolescence and can follow many into adulthood. The food you eat, the amount of stress you have, the cleanliness of your face may have some bearing on your facial blemishes, but you do have options. The real question you may be asking yourself is, “If acne will still form despite my best efforts, what is my next line of defense?” Knowledge is always a powerful tool in when you are seeking solutions.

The best treatment for acne will involve nutrition and herbs both internally and externally.  In addition to these two elements, the control of acne requires thorough, gentle cleansing.  Therefore, there are three steps to beautiful clear skin - internal treatment, external treatment, and cleansing. The best internal treatment for acne will be one that contains herbal medications.  These require no prescription.  Many other medications for acne control do require a prescription, and can only be used for severe cases. In addition, many of these prescription medications have serious side effects.  Some, like Accutane, have been found to cause depression, and even suicide.  Herbs, on the other hand, are natural, gentle, and effective. The external part of a good acne control system must have certain characteristics as well.  For one thing it needs to not be a drying formula, and yet it needs to control the oil in your skin.  It should be able to  be used on either a severe case or a mild case.  It should contain botanical ingredients that heal and strengthen the cellular structure of your skin.  The cleanser should remove extra sebum, the natural oil in your skin, which contains the bacteria that cause acne. The other part of a good quality acne control system is a lotion or gel to treat the blemishes after cleansing the face.  This product should be able to unplug the pores.  It also should fight the bacteria that causes acne.  It should also be formulated with a transdermal delivery system so that the helpful, natural ingredients are absorbed into the skin thoroughly. Why do you get acne?  The actual outer layer of skin is dead, but under this thin layer called the epidermis, the cells are alive and multiplying.  Normally your skin is shedding the old cells and replacing them with new ones.  The problem happens when too many dead skin cells clump together with the natural skin oils, called sebum, and cause the pores to get clogged. Acne is a skin disorder that actually starts two or three weeks before the blemish appears.  The beginning is the clogging of the pore.  The natural bacteria that live on the skin begin to multiply inside the pore since the excess oils can't get out.  Since the body is fighting bacteria, white blood cells arrive on the scene, and inflammation is the result. Obviously, frequent cleansing is an important step in acne control, since the extra skin cells and oils need to be removed in order to keep them from clogging the pores in the first place.  But washing too often can be drying to the skin.  For these reasons, skin cleansers need to be very gentle.

The exact reasons for adult acne is unknown but is believed to relate to the changes or imbalance in an individual’s body hormones. It is believed that the hormonal changes of an individual, at various times in his/her life, leads to the increases in the amount of oil in the skin which results to clogged pores or hair follicles in the skin. This leads waste particles to build up under the surface of one’s skin which becomes infected by bacteria and generates acne or the spots suffered by acne sufferers. Hence the main aim of any best adult acne treatment should include prevention of scarring, clearance of acne, and morbidity minimization. Acne sufferers must be advised to cleanse their skin gently using a non-comedogenic moisturizer. It is also advisable not to use harsh skin products and avoid picking and rubbing the skin.

","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" Best Way to Prevent Acne In most cases, the teenage years are when most people experience the greatest amount of acne.  This is due to hormone level fluctuations and increased sebum (oil) production.  The perfect recipe for acne! So, what is a teenager to do?  Prevention is the name of the game when it comes to acne and teens.  Unfortunately, because there is no cure for acne, prevention and control are the only things a teenager can do to control acne. The first step, is to get on a proven acne prevention routine such as the one discussed on our acne prevention page.  The next step is to utilize products that minimize acne you may already have and reduces the likelihood of future outbreaks.  Those really are the two most important things a teenager can do to combat acne. If these steps do not work, then a visit to the doctor or dermatologist may be in order.  Stronger treatments like antibiotics and Accutane may be needed- only a doctor can know for sure. For most teens though, simply following the cleanse-treat-protect routine combined with using high-quality acne treatments will be effective in minimizing acne. There sure is a lot of confusion out there regarding acne prevention.  Some people say to scrub your face all day, eat the right foods, avoid sweat, exercise, and on and on.  Unfortunately, these have nothing to do with acne prevention. he numbers really tell the story when it comes to adult acne.  25% of men between the ages of 25 and 44 experience acne.  With women the numbers are even higher- nearly 50% of all women between the ages of 25 and 44 get acne. These numbers tell a story many adult's do not want to hear.  It's not just teenagers who get acne.  Many adults will get recurrences in their 30s, 40s, and beyond. Another important fact about adult acne is that it is more likely to leave permanent scars.  This is because as skin ages it loses collagen, which is responsible for skin's elasticity.  So, with less collagen, it is harder for skin to \"bounce back\" after the tissue damage that acne can cause. Acne prevention is best accomplished by following a skin care routine that incorporates three basic steps.  In one form or another, the skin must be cleansed, treated, and protected.  As long as these steps are followed, a person's acne should improve. Acne Prevention Step 1  Cleansing Due to what we know about how acne is formed, it is pretty clear that it makes sense to gently cleanse your skin on a regular basis.  This doesn't mean scrubbing a way at your face 5 times a day.  It means using a good cleansing product to gently wash away dead skin cells and impurities.  Also, it doesn't hurt if your cleanser contains proven acne fighters like benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. Acne Prevention Step 2  Treatment For optimum acne prevention, the skin must be treated with something that minimizes bacteria (like benzoyl peroxide) or slows down the shedding of skin cells (like salicylic acid).  There are many fine manufacturers of these products who will provide guidelines as to how long these products should remain on the face and how often they should be used. Acne Prevention Step Three  Protection The last step in acne prevention is protection.  By protection, we mean that the face should be properly moisturized and protected from the sun's damaging rays.  There are a great number of quality moisturizers available that contain sunscreens in them.  Another thing to keep in mind, many acne treatments tend to dry out the skin a bit making moisturizers extra important. There you have it, a simple 3 step plan for acne prevention.

","keywords":" birth control pill acne, pregnancy and acne, hormones, contraception, dermatologist, acne treatment, acne scars ","article_body":" Acne first comes about during adolescence, when hormone levels begin to increase.This sudden flucturation of hormones causes the sebaceous glands to go into overdrive. They start generating increased levels of such oils that end up becoming clogged inside the glands. When the oils can't escape, acne results! So it goes without saying that when there is a fluctuation in the hormone levels within the body, it can trigger an increase in sebaceous oil production, and therefore increases the chance that an outbreak of acne will likely occur. With women, acne breakouts are common while they are taking birth control pills and also when they become pregnant. <b>Using Birth Control Pills to Control Acne</b> Women who do take the birth control pill and who notice that their acne is getting worse should discuss the situation with their doctor. Different types of oral contraception have differing levels of hormones and one side effect of some contraception is an increase in acne. Switching to another brand may bring acne back under control. Any woman who is healthy, and is at least age 15, who has begun menstruating and who has decided to start using oral contraception can discuss getting a prescription for a birth control pill with their doctor. There are several brands that help clear up acne but only one so far has been approved by the FDA for treatment of acne and that is Ortho Tri-cyclen. It is important to note that taking the birth control pill as a way to treat acne should be the last alternative, after all other acne treatment options have been attempted without success. The birth control pill does have side effects and it must be taken exactly as prescribed to be effective. <b>Acne During Pregnancy</b> Women who have become pregnant often report an increase in acne, too. Many changes occur within a woman's body in an effort to properly prepare the body for the growing fetus. The two primary female hormones at work in every woman's body are progesterone and estrogen. Progesterone is more androgenic than estrogen, which basically means it is more like the hormones found in men. Increased progesterone during pregnancy can cause the sebaceous glands to produce more sebaceous oils than normal and that is what can cause outbreaks of acne. If possible, the best way to handle acne during pregnancy is to realize that it is a short-term problem that will usually go away once the baby is born. If this isn't possible, discuss your options over with a dermatologist who has experience working with patients during their pregnancy. After going through your situation, the dermatologist will be able to suggest treatment options that'll make you happier with your appearance and that won't harm your baby.

It might be surprising for some to know that some birth control pills are very effective in controlling acne and cure considerably in many cases. Birth control pills control the sebum significantly to be produced. What is acne? Acne is a chronic disorder of the hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Acne is characterized by black heads, pimple outbreaks, cysts, infected abscesses, and (sometimes) scarring. Acne is the result of inflammation of the sebaceous glands and hair follicles of the skin producing pimples and pustules. Sebaceous glands (fatty glands found in hair follicles throughout the body that secrete oil into the hair and surrounding skin and they emit oil) found on many parts of the body which produce Sebum. When the production of sebum increases, it blocks the sebaceous glands, which makes sebum filling the gland into balloon shape. This is generally called as acne. If the production of sebum decreases so is the acne and vice-versa How birth control pills work on acne? Androgen are group hormones, also known as male hormones in the body are responsible for excess sebum production. Birth control pills control androgen hormones significantly. Androgen hormones’ activity in sebaceous glands either increases or decreases the production of sebum. When androgen hormones increases in sebaceous glands, its produces more sebum and so it appears in the form of acne. This activity is greatly observed in teenagers and young adults specially between the ages of 12 and 24, when they experience many physical changes. However, it must be noted here that that there are mainly two types of birth control pills available. One is Progestin Only Pill (POP) and other is Combination Pill (having progestin and estrogen hormones). These combination birth control pills come in different combination level of progestin and estrogen hormones. The estrogens may be in the form of ethinyl etradiol. In fact, this is the ethinyl etradiol that controls the level of androgen hormones in the sebaceous glands. In 1997, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved low-dose birth control pill Ortho Tri-cyclen to be used for acne treatment. It controls the production of androgen hormones in sebaceous glands and thus reduces acne to appear significantly. Despite the fact that birth control pills work effectively on acne treatment, it is certainly not advisable for sexually inactive and teenagers to use them as the medium of acne treatment unless they consult their physician or doctor first.

Benefits of Blue Light Acne Treatment Blue light acne treatment focuses on eliminating P. acnes, the bacteria that causes to acne eruptions. This bacteria pumps out some molecules called porphyrins. When these molecules are exposed to blue light, they release free radicals that kill the bacteria. Blue light acne treatment has several benefits in comparison to other therapies * It is a totally natural and has no side effects. * It is safe to use daily and for all ages. * Unlike other light therapies, it doesn't contain UV light that can hurt your skin. * It is painless and you can do it in your own home. Research Data Data from clinical trials on blue light therapy has revealed that is a promising acne treatment. Patients involved in the studies have received the blue light acne treatment in several session, each lasting about 15 minutes. Many of them, but not all, have registered significant improvement after the treatment, with approximately 55% clearance. Side effects were only mild and included short-term pigment changes, dryness and swelling of the treated area. Taiwan Thirty-one patients with facial acne on both sides have received blue light acne treatment only on one side, while the other has received no treatment at all. The therapy was given twice a week for four weeks. In the end, it was concluded that blue light acne treatment is effective unless the patient suffers from cystic acne, which often worsens when treated with blue light. United States Twenty-five patients suffering from inflammatory acne were treated with blue light therapy on one side (8 sessions in 4 weeks) and with clindamycin on the other (twice a day for 4 weeks). In the end, researchers compared the results for the two treatments. The side treated with clindamycin showed an approximately 22% improvement, while the one treated with blue light therapy showed around 40% improvement. However, after 8 weeks of no treatment, the clindamycin side had maintained the results better. Israel Three separate studies on 10, 13 and 25 patients suffering form inflammatory acne were conducted in order to measure the effects of blue light acne treatment. In all of the three studies, over 80% of all patients responded well to the treatment, showing between 59% and 67% improvement. Japan 30 patients suffering from mild to moderate acne received a blue light acne treatment twice a week for up to five weeks. For 80% of all patients, the lesions decreased by approximately 64%. The rest of them experienced negative or no effects. Unfortunately, the number of individuals involved in these research studies is too small. Generally, clinical trials aimed to test new treatments enroll hundreds or even thousands of patients. Considering the small numbers involved in the blue light acne treatment studies, no statistically valid conclusion can be drawn. However, these studies do reveal that blue light therapy has positive effects on some individuals suffering from acne. It gives best results for inflammatory acne and may not be safe to use on patients with cystic acne lesions.

Through the skin toxins are eliminated which are brought to the skin surface from the blood.  When the regular elimination channels are sluggish or partial plugged up such as your colon being constipated, not all toxins move out through your feces. Toxins that accumulate in the colon tend to move into the blood, when colon walls have been weaken through constant constipation or abused through eating excessive junk food.  Once in the blood they move into the liver for detoxification. If you are frequently constipated, than your liver will be overworked and unable to detoxify all of the colon toxins.  The liver will store a lot of these toxins in its own tissue and else where in your body’s tissues, joints, organs, cells and skin. When you have excessive toxins and your immune system is not able to detoxify them, these toxins will moved to the skin surface through the blood where they are enter the hair pores – follicles – and try to move to the skin surface.  When your pores are not working properly, excessive toxins in the pores can lead to acne. Body odor is also a result of toxins coming out through the skin that should be moving out through the other elimination channels. If your body skin is clean and its pores are open and unclogged, toxins will move out through the pores without creating pimples or eruptions.  The skin normally moves 1-2 pounds of toxins out of your skin daily. You can tell when your pores are open.  You sweat freely during exercise.  If you do not sweat much during hot weather or during exercise, then your skin pores are probably plugged. To keep your skin active and serving as a good channel of elimination you need to brush your skin daily before you shower or during your shower.  When you brush your skin, brush in one direction, starting from your feet towards your heart. In her book, Detox For Life, 2002, Loree Taylor Jordan, C.C.H., I.D. says, “One of greatest gifts of health that you can give yourself is the gift of skin brushing.  Dry skin brushing in one of the finest of all baths.  No soap can wash the skin as clean as the new skin you have under the old.  You make new skin on the body every 24 hours.

After patiently using many of the medications and treatments and perhaps even getting rid of the condition many people are left with another problem to deal with - namely scars.   It is not always possible to avoid scarring but, with careful attention, it can be minimised.   As with many things it is usually easier to prevent scarring than to try and remedy it afterwards. A fundamental rule is never to squeeze or pop pimples and spots, as this is one way that scarring can be caused.   Most people are aware of this but many would still prefer to remove the offending sight of pus filled spots by popping them, rather than suffer the embarrassment of others staring at their faces.   Sadly they can be left with a much worse problem because scarring, which is deep beneath the skin, can be very difficult to remove. There are many and varied treatments on the market which claim to remove acne scarring including lotions, creams and face washes.   But just how effective are they and, if so, to what degree?   In reality, these the ingredients of these medications can only help fade the lesser surface scarring as they cannot penetrate deep enough to remove the more heavily pitted scars. However, there is a procedure that does have a reasonable level of success with scar removal and that is acne scar laser treatment.   The one drawback with this procedure is the price as it is very expensive.   Even then, the successful treatments that are recorded do not include the really deeply pitted scars.   These are really beyond the help of any treatment and the best that can be advised is to carefully use a makeup that will, to a certain extent, help mask the disfigurement. Bear in mind when considering laser scar treatment that your individual success will depend upon several factors such as your skin type and typically how deep the scarring has gone.   Rather than seek the advice of the practitioner who is offering the treatment (where his diagnosis make be biased upon his need for business) it would be better to consult with a dermatologist specialist who is well versed in dealing with this condition.   If this specialist will not be the one to carry out the treatment you will get a much fairer diagnosis of the success rate to be expected. Should you decide to embark upon this type of treatment it is important to bear in mind that laser scar treatment is no different to any of the other topical applications in that results are not immediate.   You would require several sessions, depending upon the severity of the condition, and have to wait maybe several months to see any improvement - if any.   Nobody can predict with any certainty just how successful the outcome will be with any laser scar treatments, so it should only to be considered after much deliberation and professional consultation.   However, if you are able to afford it and your medical practitioner believes you could benefit from this technology then it may just be worth trying with the possibility of ridding yourself permanently of those disfiguring unsightly scars.

But does what you eat really have a direct influence on the status of your face? The answer is 'no', a bad food diet does not 'directly' cause an acne breakout. But, as most doctors will tell you, what you choose to put in your body will have a definite effect on your health, including your skin health. Excessive caffeine, sugary foods, and greasy, fatty snacks will all have a negative effect on our overall health. And if your skin is particularly susceptible to acne, maintaining a poor diet will definitely not help the situation. A bad food diet can therefore have an 'indirect' effect! Choosing foods that are high in sugar, fat content, and refined carbohydrates can all be damaging to your skin health. Studies have shown that too much sugar and refined carbohydrates in your diet can lead to a surge in insulin. This can create the condition known as IGF-1, where an increase in insulin creates the over-production of male hormones. And excessive male hormones can produce an excess of sebum, the greasy stuff that can clog your pores, attract bacteria, and create an environment conducive to acne! IGF-1 is also believed to cause keratinocytes to multiply, which can wreak havoc on skin. Saturated fats are the bad guys of the food world. Doctors have been warning of the health consequences of consuming trans fats and saturated fats. The negative consequences of saturated fats on the body are a weakening the immune system, promoting inflammation, and for those prone to acne breakouts, raising the skin's oil production level. Keep your body healthy and filled with good health-promoting nutrients for the best complexion possible. You should strive to reduce saturated fats -they will certainly not help you in your battle against acne. But all oils are not bad. There are also good oils which are actually conducive to healthy skin. In fact, certain oils are absolutely essential. These essential fatty acids reduce inflammation and help promote healthy skin, What oils should you add to your regular diet? Fish Oil, olive oil, and flax oil are all good oils that should become a part of your diet. Fish oil and flax oil in particular are recommended for maintaining a glowing complexion. What about vitamins and minerals? You should maintain a steady intake of vitamins and minerals to promote a healthy skin-enriching diet. Vitamin A is paramount for promoting healthy skin. Vitamin A is found in abundance in avocados and carrots. Vitamin B-6, Vitamin C, and Zinc are other important nutrients for promoting a good complexion. An easy way to ensure that you're getting all the vitamins and minerals you need to help fight acne is to eat a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, and essential fatty acids. One of the lesser-considered aspects of the food and acne debate is the role that food allergies play in promoting acne. Some people experience severe cases of acne even if they lead a very healthy diet and have never suffered from severe acne before. The cause could be a food allergy of some kind. Common causes of food allergies include excess sugar, dairy products, and certain refined flours and grains. Avoid foods rich in iodine, which have been linked to acne in the past. If you consume iodized salt, make the switch to sea salt. Iodine-rich foods may include salt, liver, cheese, crabs, shellfish, clams, and kelp products. If you find dairy products exacerbate your acne, consider switching to soy or rice milk and cheese products. Whether certain foods cause an acne or whether these foods are just one of many contributing factors is an ongoing debate. Much has been learned and much more has yet to be learned. Add to this the fact that one individual may be affected by a certain food and another not at all and you quickly learn there is no single answer, no magic bullet that will work for everyone. But hopefully this information will help you determine what works for you! "},{"title":" Causes Adult Acne ","word_count":388,"summary":" A brief article about Adult Acnes. ","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" What Causes Adult Acne? Regardless of age, acne is a condition of the sebaceous glands. These glands are attached to hair follicles and produce an oily substance called sebum. An acne lesion forms when a hair follicle becomes plugged with sebum and dead cells. The pathogenic (disease-causing) events in the sebaceous glands are believed to be due in large degree to changes in levels of androgenic (male) hormones in the body—a circumstance usually associated with the growth and development that occurs between the ages of 12 and 21. Therefore, it is important to look for an underlying cause of acne that occurs for the first time in adulthood. Acne that appears after 25 to 30 years of age occurs for one of these reasons 1.\tRecurrence of acne that cleared up after adolescence 2.   Flare-up of acne after a period of relative quiet—for example, during pregnancy 3.   Occurs for the first time in a person who had never previously had acne. Acne that appears for the first time in adulthood should be examined by a dermatologist who can investigate the underlying cause. Some causes of adult acne are *   Medication. Some medications that can induce acne include anabolic steroids (sometimes used illegally by athletes to “bulk up”), some anti-epileptic medications, the anti-tuberculosis drugs isoniazid and rifampin, lithium and iodine-containing medications. *   Chronic physical pressure on the skin. Chafing from the straps of a backpack or tucking a violin between the jaw and chin can cause chronic physical pressure on the skin and may induce a condition known as acne mechanica. *   Chlorinated industrial chemicals. These may induce the occupational skin disorder known as chloracne. *   Metabolic conditions. Changes in the hormonal balance, such as those brought about by pregnancy, menstruation or hormonal abnormalities can induce acne. It is also important to know that some lesions which appear to be acne are not acne at all. One skin condition that resembles acne is folliculitis, which occurs when the hair follicles become infected and inflamed. Folliculitis requires different treatment than acne. Acne that occurs in adulthood may be difficult to treat if there are multiple recurrences. Some patients with severe recurrent acne have undergone repeated courses of treatment with the potent systemic drug isotretinoin. Since adult acne may be difficult to treat, acne that appears for the first time in adulthood should be examined and treated by a dermatologist.

However, there are treatments available to reduce acne blemishes and scarring. ","keywords":" acne, skin lesions, skin blemishes, acne scars ","article_body":" Acne is an inflammatory skin disease that is caused due to certain biological variations in the pilosebaseous units (skin structures consisting of a hair follicle and its connecting sebaceous gland) of the skin. The most common form of acne known as \"acne vulgaris” usually appears during adolescence. Acne is caused due to excessive oil in human body. The glands in the skin secrete excessive amount of oil that block the hair follicles by combining naturally with the dead skin cells. Generally, people who eat a lot of oily food suffer from this problem. Due to acne some parts of the human body are affected. Some of them are face, arms etc. The oil secretions behind the blocked pores create a perfect environment for uncontrolled multiplication by the bacteria in the skin. In response, the skin inflames, producing the visible lesion (acne). Rashes are occurred on the body. The face, upper arms, back and chest are especially affected by acne. The certain lesions of acne are blackish elevations or pale yellow and/or small whitish bumps. More inflamed rashes take the shape of boil-like tender swellings or reddish bumps. After resolution of the blemishes, prominent unsightly acne scars may remain. The acne condition is common in puberty as a result of an abnormal response to normal levels of the male hormone testosterone. Acne occurs when the hormones are increased due to excess oil in the body.   There is however no way to predict how long acne will take to disappear completely or that it will ever recur again. Acne affects a large percentage of humans at some stage in life. Apart from leaving behind the marks of scars it has some psychological effects as well causing stress and depression. Therefore acne should not be neglected and should be treated with great care and responsibility to ensure a healthy life.

Doesn’t sound fun, does it? Good thing there are ways to prevent the problem, but first you must understand what causes it to form. Doctors are unsure of the exact cause of this disorder, but many believe it to be due to several different reasons. During puberty, in both males and females, an increase in hormones called androgens cause the sebaceous glands to enlarge, thereby producing more sebum. Additionally, hormonal changes due to pregnancy can also cause this skin disorder. Genetics also seem to play a role in the formation, meaning the tendency to develop it can stem from whether your parents had it or not. Pore-clogging cosmetics and certain drugs (Lithium, for example) have also been known to make the situation even worse. What can make it worse? Well, for starters, friction. Rubbing, excessive scrubbing, or leaning on the skin, especially your face, can lead to an increase. However, chocolate and greasy foods do not cause this problem. Neither does stress nor dirty skin. It’s nice to know we can still enjoy a chocolate bar without worrying about a gigantic pimple cropping up! If you suffer from this problem, know that you are not alone. People from all age groups and races can get it, from adolescents to even adults. It is often treated by dermatologists, who are doctors trained specifically in skincare. While very good at treating all types, they specialize in treating more severe cases. For moderate cases, seeing your primary physician should be sufficient. Stopping scarring, psychological distress and prevention, while also healing preexisting problems, are the main goals of any practitioner. Your doctor will discuss with you treatment options, and whether over the counter, prescription drugs or a combination of both will be the most effective treatment for your particular case. There’s no doubt that it's embarrassing, not to mention unsightly. To avoid any reoccurrence, especially if you are using anything to treat the condition, be sure you follow a few key steps Wash your face twice a day with a mild cleanser, and do not scrub too hard. Also, try to stay away from pore clogging makeup and cosmetics, because that will have a detrimental effect on your skin. Avoid excessive exposure to sunlight as much as possible, and if you must go out wear a mild sunscreen to prevent burning.

Find out how all three causes of acne work together to produce the damage that can lead to scarring. ","keywords":" causes of acne, acne, acne scars ","article_body":" The causes of acne are not fully understood, but dermatologists have certainly evolved in their knowledge and treatment approaches. During the process, many things that were believed to be associated with acne have either been ruled out, or modified with a deeper understanding. Acne can occur at any time during a person's life. Whilst many people suffer acne during teenage years, not having acne then does not mean it may not develop as an adult. However, genetics does play a role. So if someone in your family has acne, there is a greater chance of developing it. But acne is not contagious. During teenage years, for women who are menstruating, and women going through menopause, there are hormonal changes that are associated with acne. Acne sufferers have oil producing glands that are more sensitive to regular levels of the hormone testosterone in their blood. Sometimes too much testosterone is produced. Women have small amounts of testosterone also, and for some women, adrenal or ovarian disease is an underlying cause of acne which causes excess production of these male hormones. Testosterone, or the body's heightened responsiveness to it, causes the oil glands to produce more oil than they should. Here, other factors such as excess shedding of the dead skin cells lining the hair follicle, a narrowing of the hair follicles, and irregular clumping of the cells within the hair follicles, come into play. The end result is that the follicles become clogged with dead skin cells and oil, and the opening of the follicle is blocked. This is called a comedone. This environment favors the multiplication of the acne bacteria, Propionibacterium acnes. This bacteria lives on the skin and is normally harmless. But the oil and dead cells in the clogged pore are like food to it, and the breakdown products of this bacteria's mealtime is irritating to the skin. If the bacteria multiply to the extent that the follicle wall breaks open, lesions can develop. The role of inflammation in acne is being studied to give new insights into how to approach acne treatment. The inflammatory process within the skin can attract molecules that break down the collagen in the skin. This can lead to permanent damage - scarring. A research team at the University of Michigan is looking at testing treatments that reduce the intensity of the immune system's response to the effects of the 'acne invasion'. By reducing the level of inflammation, they hope to prevent acne scarring.

","keywords":" acne, acne solutions, skin care, acne treatment, beauty tips, Proactive, Proactive solution, Proactiv ","article_body":" When most people think about acne and acne products they tend to think about teenagers hoping to be acne free for prom.  While buying acne skin care products are a part of the teen years’ experience, for many people, acne and acne scars follow them beyond their teenage years into adulthood. Unfortunately adult onset acne doesn’t always respond to even the best acne treatments or acne products available at your corner drugstore.  Acne products that are sold over the counter usually contain a little medication, which does little to help the cystic acne that most adults suffer from. Cystic acne can cause deep scars meaning that not only must the sufferer purchase acne skincare treatments; they must also purchase acne scar treatment products as well. Cystic Acne isn’t always easy to treat. It can be a result of hormonal imbalances the stem from conditions such as Poly Cystic Ovary Syndrome or even Insulin Resistance.  Since acne products don’t treat the medical conditions that often are the cause of adult acne, becoming acne free isn’t easy.  Adult acne treatment just isn’t as simple as applying an over the counter cream or slew of acne products on a few pimples every night. The best acne treatments for adult onset acne are all inclusive; they clean, hydrate, and protect.  Some dermatologists recommend changes in diet to help adults become acne free, but diet alone, without the help of some form of adult acne treatment, usually won’t clear things up. Just washing your face with acne skin care products doesn’t usually work either. In fact using too many acne products can actually make the problem worse. The best acne treatments are those that are gentle yet effective, all inclusive, and simple to use.  Finding adult acne treatment that meets those standards used to be difficult, until two Stanford dermatologists set to work to create a line of acne products that not only treat adult acne, but in doing so, help to prevent the onset of acne scars.  Their product, Proactiv Solution, has transformed the world of acne products.  It has been called one of the best acne treatments by doctors and their patients because it really tackles the problems of adult onset acne. Proactive Solution is more than just a topical treatment.  It is an acne management system that gets to the root of the problem and not only heals the acne that you have, but also prevents future outbreaks. Most of the acne skin care treatment options on the market today are more interested in treating existing acne, but do little to prevent your acne from returning. This means that the chances for acne scars is increased and costly acne scar treatment products or even surgery might be in your future. Proactiv Solution is just that a Proactive Solution! The best defense is a strong offense and Proactiv Solution penetrates deep into your skin to immobilize bacteria. Even though Proactive Solution is designed to be used everyday, it is gentle on your skin. Unlike other chemical laden acne treatments that make your skin dry and flaky, Proactiv Solution is formulated with soothing botanicals like allantoin, panthenol, aloe, and chamomile.  It hydrates your skin and leaves it feeling smooth and delicate. Because Proactiv Solution helps to treat acne before it becomes evident on your skin, it is a great prevention for acne scars and expensive acne scar treatments.  Used just twice a day, the formula is a great way to not only restore your skin to its former glory; it is a great way to keep it healthy. Proactive Solution is easy to use. The three step process works together to annihilate acne. You simply wash with the exfoliating renewing cleanser, unclog your pores with the revitalizing cleanser, and then attack bacteria by smoothing on the repairing lotion. The whole process only takes a minute or two each day, but the result is acne free skin for good. Even women that suffer from cystic acne caused by Polycystic Ovary Syndrome are reporting great results from using Proactiv.  Before this revolutionary treatment was designed, women that suffered from PCOS were forced to try and hide their acne with heavy makeup, but using Proactiv is actually helping many women to smile at the face they see in the mirror each day. Adult onset acne is never easy to deal with. It is hard to cope with a condition that you never expected to face once you left adolescence. It no longer needs to be something you spend a lot of time worrying about. With the power of Proactive Solution in your court, clear skin is closer than you think.  Not only does it clear your acne, helping to prevent further outbreaks and ugly scarring, it leaves your face feeling soft, supple, and hydrated, unlike over the counter ointments that leave your skin red and dry.

Puberty though is also fraught with frustrations and changes, including physical changes in their bodies that often leave the teenagers with less than desirable pimples on the face. Acne commonly occurs during the adolescence period. It is often caused by excessive secretion of oil from the glands. The typical acne lesions that appear on the face and body are comedones, papules, pustules and pimples.

Worldwide there are about 60 million people who are suffering from acne. Most people develop acne during adolescence. It is most prevalent in those aged 16 to 18 years. The exact cause of acne is unknown, but doctors believe it results from several related factors. One important factor is an increase in hormones called androgens (male sex hormones). These increase in both boys and girls during puberty and cause the sebaceous glands to enlarge and make more sebum. Hormonal changes related to pregnancy or starting or stopping birth control pills can also cause acne. The most common reasons for acne are •  There are higher levels of sex hormones at puberty than in younger children. •  These hormones are converted in the skin to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) which stimulates oil glands to enlarge. •  The oil glands, called sebaceous glands, produce sebum. The more sebum, the more likely it is that acne will be troublesome. •  If sebum and keratin (dead skin cells) block the skin pores, comedones can develop. •  The wall of the follicles may rupture. •  Bacteria and comedonal debris cause acne pimples or pustules (inflammatory lesions). Aggravating factors Some people have particularly severe acne. This may be because of •  Genetic factors (family members have bad acne). Researchers believe that the tendency to develop acne can be inherited from parents. For example, studies have shown that many school-age boys with acne have a family history of the disorder. •  Hormonal factors (higher levels of androgenic hormones) due to •\tPolycystic ovaries (common) •\tEnzyme deficiency eg sterol hydroxylase deficiency (very rare) •\tExcessive corticosteroids (eg Cushing's disease) (rare) •\tPsychological stress and depression •  Environmental factors such as •\tHigh humidity causing swelling of the skin •\tCosmetics especially certain moisturisers, foundation and pomades (watch out for lanolin, petrolatum, vegetable oils, butyl stearate, lauryl alcohol and oleic acid) •\tPetroleum oils. •\tPressure from headbands & chin straps (eg \"fiddler's neck\"). •  Pressure from sports helmets or equipment, backpacks, tight collars, or tight sports uniforms •  Stress can also cause the production of hormones, such as cortisol, which can aggravate acne. Stress brings upon different hormone levels. With hormone changes the body prompts the skins oil glands to enlarge, secreting more oil. Which causes white heads, black heads and pimples. •  Certain medications. Vitamins are good for your body, But an excess of vitamins B1, B6 and B12 can cause acne flare-ups. These vitamins are good for the skin, but avoid overuse. •  Picking and squeezing can actually send the infection deeper into the skin and can cause scarring.

","keywords":" acne, benzoyl peroxide, acne treatment, proactiv, proactive, skin care ","article_body":" Cystic acne is a more advanced case of a pimple. Millions of people around the world have some kind of acne or another, but cystic acne is one of the more severe types out there. It develops from a regular pimple, also known as a pustule, by rooting itself deeper within the skin and forming a painful sore known as a cyst. These cysts can vary in size and color from small and pink to large and a dark purple. In severe cases, multiple cysts in the facial area and on the body can be extremely painful. While almost everyone is exposed to some kind of acne at some point in his or her life, cystic acne seems to be largely hereditary. If one of your parents had or has cystic acne, there is a higher percent chance that you will be exposed to some form of it as well. On the face may be the worst, but cystic acne can form on other parts of the body also. It commonly appears on the chest, legs, neck, shoulders, and back. These cysts can be covered by clothes, but be cautious tight-fitting clothing can further irritate and dry out the skin, leading to more painful cysts. It is a good idea to try and wear loose fitting clothing when suffering from bodily acne. When a person is going through a cycle of cystic acne, they can often be desperate for a fast cure. One of the known medications found to be effective for severe cystic acne is Isotretinoin. It is found in the prescription drug Accutane and is a concentrated form of Vitamin A. While it is proven to be effective in severe cases of acne, Accutane should be used as a last resort because of its side effects. In pregnant women, it has been known to cause birth defects and even possible miscarriages. Women who are prescribed Accutane are required to also use two forms of birth control to prevent conception. If you are a woman, you may want to consider a product that is still effective without being quite so potent. Many women have found success with deep cleaners such as Neutrogena or <a href=http//www.crescatsententia.org>Proactiv solution</a> , products that contain higher levels of benzoyl peroxide, a substance proven to be safe for pregnant women to use. Another advantage of trying other products before seeing a dermatologist is the cost, as consulting a physician can very often be pretty expensive. It may be cheaper to find out that a treatment available without a prescription worked as well as a cure that required a doctor visit. Whatever treatment you decide is best for yourself, remember that cystic acne can be overcome. There are many treatments available and you may not find the most effective one right at first. Talking to a physician or dermatologist may be able to point you in the right direction on your way to a clearer complexion.

Isotretinoin is the most common, and most potent drug prescribed for cystic acne treatment. It is a man-made form of retinoid (Vitamin A) that is taken in pill form. It is the only prescription that treats excess oil production, clogged skin pores, and inflammation. This pill is taken up to 20 weeks and commonly does not require more than one course of therapy to cure. The most serious side-effect to taking this medication is the possibility of birth defects to a developing fetus. For this reason, women are required to not be pregnant or get pregnant at any time during this treatment. Regular check-ups are scheduled for each patient using this medication to monitor any additional side effects. Common side effects of using isotretinoin as a cystic acne treatment include muscle aches, uncomfortable drying of the lips and eyes, depression, and chest pain. Some of these side effects can cause serious health problems in the future. Always contact your doctor if you notice any of these side effects. Oral contraceptives are used as cystic acne treatment in females.  It suppresses overactive sebaceous (oil producing) glands, and is safe to be used long-term. In addition to an oral contraceptive, the doctor may prescribe a synthetic steroid to inhibit other hormones that stimulate the sebaceous glands. If oral cystic acne treatment does not work, they may require drainage. This is considered acne surgery and should only be performed by a professional, in a sterile environment. If you attempt to squeeze or pick them yourself, the infection may last much longer than it would have. You may cause the infection to worsen and increase the inflammation and swelling. For dramatically inflamed cysts, a dermatologist may decide to administer an injection with a highly-diluted corticosteroid to bring down the inflammation and increase the speed of healing. It is a generally painless procedure. It usually clears the cyst within a week and prevents rupturing and scarring. However, this is not the first choice of cystic acne treatment by most dermatologist because it only treats current acne. In addition to the medications your dermatologist prescribes to you, be responsible for the health of your skin. Wash your face at least once a day, especially following exercise or other sweat-inducing activity. Do not wash your skin too often or it could result in drying out. Bursting of cystic acne will most likely result in scars, so avoid this at all costs. Make sure your hands and fingers stay away from your face. Your hands pick up dirt and germs with everything you touch and this coming in contact with your face can increase the chance of infection.

These scars can often be difficult to remove, with various forms of facial surgery being a typical option. In most cases, the scars can be prevented by just taking a few measures while the acne is still present, such as using the medication properly. ","keywords":" infection, side effect, inflammation, surgery ","article_body":" Acne, unlike your typical infection, is not something that's over and done with if you manage to make it go away. You still have to deal with the after-effects left behind by the problem. Acne scarring is one of the most common problems encountered during the post-infection stage.  If not treated properly, acne can leave physical marks. Acne scarring, with the social stigma that it tends to generate, may end up becoming an even bigger problem than the acne that caused it.  No wonder, some people actually see depression as one of the more serious effects of this kind of skin problem. Treating the acne problem properly at the early stages of infection is critical to prevent the formation of scars. There is a wide array of things you may do to lower the chances of scar formation. The first and most important step is to control the skin infection.  Other important things to remember in controlling acne include the following l\tTreat the acne infection as early as possible. This reduces the chances of scars forming later on. l\tAvoid using more than one treatment unless advised by a doctor. Multiple treatments may only cause drug interaction side effects. l\tIf your acne is creating cysts, avoid attempting to prick or tamper with them in any way. Doing so may increase your chances of the cyst forming a scar later on. l\tWhenever possible, prevent inflammation. Statistically speaking, areas that have experienced inflammation during an acne outbreak tend to form scars afterwards. If you develop acne scars, you would be better off avoiding any sort of treatment you found over the Internet, regardless of what it claims to be. Internet remedies are ill-advised measures, as all actual medications for acne scarring require a doctor's prescription and may only be obtained through the office of a medical professional. The “Internet remedies” simply don't work, even if they could theoretically relieve the acne that caused the scars, so you may find it a better idea to consult a dermatologist. There are more than a few ways to fix acne scarring, if you find the need for it.  The likelihood that your dermatologist will suggest one from among the following forms of surgery will vary depending on how deep your acne scars run and how severe the problem actually is. Dermabrasion, which involves the use of machinery with diamond-tipped blades to cut away the scarred skin, is one such option. If you only have shallow scarring left over from your acne, then your doctor might suggest this type of scar-removal surgery. It removes the scar tissue to let the skin replace the removed sections naturally, leaving you with a new layer of skin. Naturally, creams and treatments are used to help in the healing process. Another option is through the use of pinpoint medical lasers, albeit this is an option that is not suggested very often. Laser surgery works on the same general concept as dermabrasion, though you would be put under a high-powered laser rather than a set of diamond-bladed tools. This method is seen to be more accurate than using the aforementioned technique, and may sometimes be recommended for slightly deeper acne scars. However, this is undertaken and suggested only by the people with experience in this type of surgery, as the slightest mishandling can cause damage that's not just skin-deep. If the state of your scarring is not that severe or pronounced, a dermatologist can offer chemical treatments rather than surgery. These treatments operate on the same idea as the two above treatments, but work on an entirely different level. This might involve the use of acids in removing the layer of skin that has the scars, allowing the body to naturally repair the damaged skin. As with both of the above methods, there are some additional products given to help the skin heal after the treatment. Also, excessive or improper use of these treatments can cause side effects that are disastrous on the skin. It is also important to be aware that discoloration usually occurs when there is an inflammation in the skin.  These discolored spots should not be immediately considered as acne scars.  In some cases, they discoloration occurs due to the increase of blood flow to that part of the skin. For that reason, it is always best to consult a skin care professional to help determine whether some areas are just discolored or if they are actual acne scars.   Being well-informed will help keep your skin safe.  Moreover, having a proper diagnosis will help you make a decision on whether your next skin care treatment will involved surgery or not.

Similarly, dermabrasion cannot be performed for a minimum of 6 months, preferably up to 1 year, after taking oral isotretinoin. Its use needs to be stopped well before the surgery. You need to tell your cosmetic surgeon about any herbal supplements that you may be taking as some of these supplements may interfere with anesthesia and cause problems during the surgery because of their blood thinning properties. Even some over-the-counter vitamins can be hazardous to you, for example vitamin E, which reduces your body’s ability to clot blood. Similarly, you may have to discontinue the use of anti-depressants. Just before the dermabrasion is performed for acne scars under anesthesia, your skin will be pretreated with an ice pack for 20 to 30 minutes and sprayed with the a liquid refrigerant. Most dermabrasion procedures for scar treatment are performed using local anesthesia with or without the sedative. Your cosmetic surgeon may also give you some medication.

Tons of acne medications get sold every year, this is a clear indication that people with acne are determined to get rid of them, at all cost. Some of these acne medications though simply cover up acne and do not really treat them. Getting rid of acne should be from its roots, their cause. Acne is the result of abundant amount of toxics in the body. These toxics can be an amassing of fat not properly disposed off, or accumulation of hormones the body produces. When the kidney, liver and the bowels could not dispose all of these toxins, they need to dispel them some other way. The body releases them either through the lungs or through the skin. This is when a breakout of acne can occur. The toxins released through your skin are the dirt and oil that causes the acne to swell up and get the pores infected. That is why most dermatologists recommend having the face and neck scrubbed regularly with soap and water to rid of these toxins. With a well-cleansed face, you eliminate the chances for the pores to be infected. Untreated acne can cause ugly scarring in the affected area that could be permanent. This blemish to the face could be quite hard to remove. Therefore, to prevent acne from happening you need to clean your face regularly as well as cut down on foods that are full of fats and hard to digest foods. Also cleanse your bowels and your waste system so that you won't have a build-up of toxins in your body. "},{"title":" Do Cosmetics Causes Acne? ","word_count":1073,"summary":" Is your temporary solution part of the problem? ","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" For decades, dermatologists and cosmetologists alike have debated the effects of cosmetics on the skin, particularly in acne sufferers. Make-up has often been branded an “acne Catch-22” — you want something to cover the redness, but you’re told it may actually be causing your acne. Fortunately, this is only partly true. To understand how to approach the make-up issue, we should start with a discussion of “cosmetic acne.” Cosmetic Acne & Skin Care - A mild-mannered cousin. Acne cosmetica, or acne that is caused by cosmetics, is a mild and fairly common form of acne. Because it is triggered by topical products rather than the complex process that creates true acne, it can strike anyone — even people who are not physiologically prone to the condition. Characterized by small, rashy pink bumps on the cheeks, chin and forehead, it typically develops over the course of a few weeks or months and may persist indefinitely. If you've recently started using a new skincare product and you're experiencing any of the symptoms listed above, discontinue use of the new product for a few days and see if your breakout subsides. NOTE While studies have shown that make-up does not cause true acne, it can exacerbate the condition. So it’s helpful to be aware of common topical triggers, no matter what kind of acne you have. Cosmetic Acne & Skin Care - The culprit Comedogenics. Ever wonder where your make-up goes over the course of the day? Some of it is rubbed off by contact with your hands and your clothing, and some of it migrates across your skin, settling into your pores — much like rainwater collects wherever there are small holes in the ground. Some make-ups include ingredients that are considered comedogenic, or substances that are known to clog pores. Although these cosmetics may not cause true plugging of the follicle, certain ingredients may induce follicular irritation. The result? The small, persistent bumps known as “cosmetic acne.” Do Cosmetics Causes Acne? Get Help with Your Acne - 60-Day Money-Back Guarantee Cosmetic Acne & Skin Care - Seven rules for a clean beauty routine. With so many products making so many claims, it’s easy to be confused by clever marketing. Fortunately, just a bit of education can get you on the path to choosing the proper cosmetics and using them wisely. Here are seven good rules to follow for a healthy make-up regimen 1. Avoid penetrating oils. Contrary to popular belief, not all oils are comedogenic. Petroleum products, mineral oil and sunflower oil do not penetrate into the pore. Most cosmetic oils, however, can aggravate acne — so it’s best to avoid them. One of the most common acne triggers in skin products, especially lotions and sunscreens, is lanolin, a fatty acid extracted from sheep’s wool. Isopropyl Myristate, which promotes smooth, even application in many foundations, is such an aggressive penetrator that it’s the main ingredient in most rust-removers! In general, products labeled “oil-free” and \"non-comedogenic\" are less likely to clog your pores and trigger breakouts. 2. Steer clear of sweet smells. Fragrance is a major cause of allergic and irritant reactions on the face. Even products that claim to be \"unscented\" may include fragrances added to mask the smell of other ingredients. It’s best to stick with products labeled as “fragrance-free” or “hypo-allergenic.” Of course, reactions to fragrance differ dramatically, and you may find certain perfumes that don’t affect your skin. The most common offenders are fragrances in the ambrette, bergamot, cinnamate and musk families. If the derivatives of your favorite face cream or foundation’s scent are not easily determined from the product label, try a patch test on the skin behind your ear. If no irritation appears after three days of repeated application, you may continue usage on a larger area. 3. Be smart about shadow and blush. The stuff that puts the sparkle in your eye shadow, face powder and blush is usually mica, a common mineral. The jagged, flaky shape of mica particles can cause irritation and/or clogging in the follicle, so it’s best to use products without too much shimmer. Likewise, many of the red dyes used to put a bloom in your cheeks are coal tar derivatives; not surprisingly, these substances are comedogenic, too. Check the labels for blushes that use carmine, which has been a natural, healthy cosmetic colorant since the time of the Aztecs. Also, cream blushes are more likely to have comedogenic ingredients, so stick to powder or gel blushes. 4. Get wise to eye creams. Because of the delicacy of the skin around the eyes, creams created for this area are often thicker and greasier than regular facial moisturizers. Heavy eye creams and oily eye make-up removers can promote milia, tiny white cysts under the eyes. These kinds of products can also migrate to neighboring areas, creating acne on the cheeks, temples and forehead. 5. Style your hair with care. Most hair products are full of the ingredients we’d like to keep away from our skin alcohol, adhesives and oils. So if you’re prone to acne, use care when styling your hair — cover your skin when you spray, and try to keep oils, mousses, gels and pomades away from the skin at the hairline. And don’t use hair products when you exercise; perspiration from your scalp can carry styling products onto your skin, contributing to new breakouts. 6. Wash after exercising. While we know that sweat doesn’t cause acne, it can promote it in those who are prone — and make-up can make matters worse. Even non-comedogenic products can cause clogging or irritation in the presence of heavy perspiration. As a rule, it’s best to wash immediately after exercising with a medicated exfoliating cleanser. 7. Use the right lip lube. If you have problems with pimples around the mouth area, you might want to reconsider the products you use on your lips. Lipsticks and glosses are greasy by nature, with high concentrations of petroleum, wax and other comedogenic substances. The greater the shine, the greater the potential for pore-clogging — so if you're breaking out, try going for a matte finish rather than a high gloss. In general, it’s fine to doll up! Just choose your cosmetics carefully — look for products that are oil-free and non-comedogenic. Read labels carefully to avoid common topical triggers. And of course, use your common sense; if a product that looks okay on the label is irritating your skin, discontinue usage right away.

","keywords":" skin, acne, skin care, pregnancy, regimen, pregnant ","article_body":" Pregnancy usually brings along with it a host of medical concerns which prompt behavioral and lifestyle changes.  It is common knowledge that pregnant women should avoid smoking and drinking, not to mention some excessively physical activities.  But there are also a host of other medicines and procedures which should be avoided during pregnancy.  So, the question is, how does pregnancy affect acne skin care regimens? Many acne medicines are quite explicit about the fact that you should not use them during pregnancy.  Roaccutane and Accutane are certainly among these.  For those of us that have used the products, the medicine packaging picturing a pregnant woman with an ‘X’ over her sent a strong message that they should not be used if you are, or might become pregnant.  There are other medicines, such as Tetracycline tablets and topical retinoids such as Tretinoin and Adapalene which can have detrimental effects on the bones and teeth of developing fetuses.  While these medicines should clearly be avoided because of the detrimental effects they have on your baby, there are other medicines which should potentially be stopped simply because they are no longer appropriate when pregnant. Pregnancy is often associated with a period of drier than normal skin.  As a result, a number of acne medicines which are designed specifically to dry out the skin, namely benzoyl peroxide cream or gel may no longer be appropriate. But does this mean that there are no acne skin care regimens that can be followed? Absolutely not.  There are in fact a number of milder and often natural solutions which can contribute to healthier acne free skin which either have no, or even positive effects on your child.  To replace harsh creams or gels designed to dry out the skin, an excellent alternative is tea tree oil.  A milder facial wash can also provide the cleansing effect of an acne wash without over-drying your skin, which is naturally drier due to pregnancy.  But because you may be giving up some of the acne fighting power by switching over to a milder wash, it is a good idea to supplement your acne fighting regimen with some natural clay masks such as Kaolin and Bentonite which will absorb oil and clear blocked pores naturally. The second avenue through which pregnant women can clear up their skin while positively affecting the health of the child, is through their diet.  By consuming higher quantities of raw vegetables, whose antioxidant properties serve to take free radicals (also referred to as bacteria) out of your system, you can cut down on the amount of bacteria released through your pores.  In addition, by cutting back on the quantity of sugars and refined carbohydrates that you eat, you will naturally cut down on the amount of sebum or oil that your body produces.  This will keep your pores clearer and allow the bacteria which passes through your pores to come out cleanly and without causing infection and acne. These approaches, in addition to providing you with clearer skin, are a safe and healthy alternative to acne fighting while simultaneously improving the health of your child.

The disease affects at least 14 million people in the United States of America, typically between 20 and 50 years of age. The main symptoms of the skin condition are - a burning or tingling sensation - a persistant redness after blushing or flushing - pimples, papules or pustules on the face - tiny visible blood vessels under the skin - thickening of skin, especially around the nose area - gritty, uncomfortable eyes (ocular rosacea) The true cause of rosacea is not really known but certain factors are known to aggravate the condition. Sufferers should avoid exposure to extreme temperatures and weather, such as the sun, the cold and wind. Sun avoidance is particularly important, and sun screens, hats and parasols are useful ways to avoid sun-related flare-ups. Alcohol and hot drinks and food are also known to excacerbate rosacea, as is exercising in hot temperatures and hot showers, baths, steam rooms and saunas. Loofahs, rough towels, exfoliators, astringents and cosmetics with perfumes and many additives should also be avoided. Gentle perfume-free cover-up cosmetics can help disguise a flare-up and reduce the psychological and social effects of rosacea. Rosacea is a condition that is controlled rather than cured and many people find that keeping a diary helps them to pin-point their own triggers. Keeping cool, drinking water to stay hydrated and using natural gentle skin care products go a long way to controlling this chronic condition. You should, of course, consult your dermatologist for advice about prescription creams and other procedures that may be available to relieve the symptoms of rosacea.  Generally, rosacea treatment is aimed at the control of redness, inflammation and skin eruptions, and this treatment is necessary to prevent permanent damage to the skin. If he decides that you do have rosacea, a dermatologist will often prescribe a combination of oral antibiotics and the use of antibiotic gel as initial treatment. The oral antibiotics will reduce the redness and reduce the pustules, then the topical gel may help to keep the symptoms under control. The dermatologist will also be able to help a patient look at lifestyle factors to help control the rosacea in the future. Steroids are also often prescribed for rosacea because they appear to relieve the symptoms quickly,  but sufferers should be aware that topical steroids are thought to make the symptoms worse longterm. The steroids dilate the blood vessels in the face and thin the skin and dermis by breaking down elastin and collagen in the skin's structure. Topical steroids have actually been thought to cause rosacea in the first place in some instances. "},{"title":" Does Acne Pamper Your Look?

","keywords":" acne, acne control, acne treatment, acne medicine ","article_body":" There are many allegations as to the causes of acne. As technology and science help us find the actual roots, we are able to dispel many of the misconceptions surrounding acne. However, the myths still persist. Here are some more commonly known myths Myth Acne is caused by poor hygiene. Lack of cleanliness is not the reason for acne. There are skin infections associated with acne due to a mixture of sebum and dead cells that lie beneath the surface of the skin. Although gentle cleansing of the skin with soap and water once or twice a day will assist in keeping skin as healthy as possible, it is ineffective in clearing away the skin infections. Take care not to scrub too hard as this could further aggravate acne. Myth Grease and Chocolate will cause acne. People have believed for years that eating chocolate will cause pimples. There is no scientific proof for this - studies have shown no direct relationship between consuming chocolate and acne breakouts. This is also true of other foods like potato chips and French fries. Eating too much of these types of food is, however, unhealthy, and advisable to eat in moderation. Note Although chocolate and greasy foods do not cause acne, some foods DO seem to exacerbate it. Milk and foods high in iodine (as found in seafood) seem to aggravate acne. Myth Sex is directly linked to acne. Everything from masturbation to celibacy has been blamed for acne. This again is false. Although there is a link between hormone levels and sexual activity, it is unclear what the link between sex and levels of sebum (causing acne.) Emotions and stress also affect hormone levels. Myth You will grow out of acne. Acne may last a matter of weeks or as long as several years. There is no need to try to live with it when there are so many over-the-counter treatments available to anyone suffering from the discomfort and embarrassment of acne. Dermatologists are also easily accessible for more severe cases. Myth Acne only affects teenagers. Although 85% of adolescents experience acne, adults are susceptible to suffering from acne when they are in their 30s or 40s. Myth Acne is only a superficial condition. Due to the severity of physical disfigurement acne leads to psychological stress. There are strong links to depression, social withdrawal and low self-esteem. Myth Popping/Squeezing pimples will get rid of them faster. This may actually aggravate acne by spreading the bacteria which is causing it! Squeezing pimples can also lead to permanent scarring. Myth Sun exposure will help clear up acne. Although short-term effects of the sun seem to dry out excess oils, the skin quickly adapts to sun exposure. This eliminates long-term benefits from sun exposure and increases the potential for skin damage and cancer. Myth Wearing makeup causes acne. Healthy skin is the best way to avoid acne. Because some makeups can clog pores, acne can in fact result. Cosmetics have flooded the market with labels indicating they are noncomedogenic or nonacnegenic, which means they will not cause acne. These brands of makeup are safe to use. Some actually include ingredients that help treat acne. Myth Using more acne medication will treat the condition quicker. Excess use of ointments may actually irritate the skin, worsening the condition. Oral medications can be dangerous to your overall health. Always use medications as directed.

Some questions they ask themselves may be; How did this happen? What can I do to get back to normal as quickly as possible? With so many products and homemade cures available, how do I know which one is the best for me? After all, we all have different skin types and genetics. So how am I going to get my hands on the right thing for myself? The answer may be found on a medicated pad, such as Oxy-10, a facial cream, such as <a href= http//www.crescatsententia.org>ProActive solution</a>, a bottle of prescription pills, or it could be as easy as making a few lifestyle changes that lead to better health and an improved complexion as well. It seems that sometimes no matter what we do there is always another break out right around the corner, but with a few simple changes you can better prevent and control your blemishes, or at least keep them to a minimal. The proper amount of vitamins, minerals, and fiber in your diet are known to be agents in good skin health. So be sure to eat foods that contain these important ingredients. Unfortunately, that’s not a big cheeseburger from your local fast food chain. These ingredients are found in fruits, vegetables, and other low-fat, highly nutritional foods. A deficiency of vitamins is a known agent in causing acne outbreaks. This can lead to the exposure of bacteria that causes outbreaks. Some people get acne outbreaks from an excess of stress. The vitamin B complex acts as a stress reliever. Because of the many types of B vitamin, an individual seeking a vitamin regiment to help fight off acne should consult a dermatologist before starting. A dermatologist can be very helpful in helping acne sufferers find the right solution to help. A healthy diet with a combination of topical solutions such as <a href= http//www.crescatsententia.org>ProActive solution</a> or Neutrogena is often one of the most effective ways to minimize acne outbreaks. Vitamin C is arguably the most important nutrient for the body’s healthy function and maintained skin appearance. It is an essential ingredient in over 300 metabolic functions within the body. In addition, it is essential in preventing a number of illnesses and helps the body heal and repair itself more rapidly. It improves the immune system and enhances the endocrine system; which means Vitamin C has a direct link to how your skin and face look. So take a look at your diet. If you drink carbonated, highly sugared soft drinks, switch over to plenty of juices and lots of water. Water is a natural flushing agent that purges your bodily systems and helps maintain clear skin. The juices will not only keep you away from the processed sugar found in candies and sodas, but it will also give your body many of the essential vitamins needed to fight acne causing agents. The same goes for food. Rather than trying to get enough vitamins through a multi-vitamin pill, eat plenty of fruits and vegetables not only to provide your body with essential nutrients but also to cut down on foods that will hurt your efforts of acne prevention. Apples and blueberries are said to be particularly effective in the prevention of new acne outbreaks. Remember, your body is a machine that works for you. With a little effort and care, you can function and look better in your life. Good nutrition is one of the fundamental steps in making your beautiful skin a reality.

The medical community to help resolve this skin dilemma presents various acne medications and therapeutic methods. Formulation of various medications and solutions are being studied cautiously to finally come up with the most effective acne treatment. But the question is, which among these medications is or are really effective acne treatments? Here's a rundown of the various acne treatments that claim to be successful in dealing with the troubles of acne according to the type or severity of acne Mild or juvenile acne. This type of acne, also known as teenage spots, may be treated with over-the-counter (OTC) topical medicines available in drugstores. They are considered to be easiest to treat. Some prescription topical medicines are also effective acne treatments. They include antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide, adapalene and tretinoin. These acne treatments help stunt the growth of bacteria and reduce inflammation. Depending on the skin type of the person, a doctor will prescribe the appropriate effective acne treatment. For instance, if one is with an oily skin, creams and lotions will not be advised since they are oil-based medications. Gels and solutions will suit more the oily skin since they are usually alcohol-based and tend to dry the skin. These medications are often subject to testing first before one could really consider them as effective acne treatments for their skin problem. As a case-by-case basis, side effects from topical medicines may surface. These side effects may include rashes, stinging, redness, burning, scaling and discoloration. Moderate to severe acne. Those with oily skin and used to have mild acne (often in their late teens or early twenties) may worsen into a moderate condition of acne. Moderate severity is often characterized with the presence of more whiteheads and redness on the affected spots due to the vessels rupture. Severe acne is when acne has already reached the entire face, back and neck of the person. Usually severe acne conditions translate to bigger spots. This kind of acne is often treated with oral antibiotics. Oral means taking them by mouth. These effective acne treatments work by curbing the reproduction of bacteria and reducing inflammation. With dealing with moderate to severe acne conditions, a combination of prescription topical medications and oral acne medications may be combined. Some topical medications like sulphur drug preparations are considered extremely effective acne treatments. Sulphur has a peeling effect on the skin, thus loosens it and dislodges the blackheads from the pores. Sulphur, as an effective acne treatment, has no known major side effects. But still, it is always advised to test any medication before applying or taking them. Samples of effective acne treatments in the form of oral antibiotics are tetracycline, minocycline, isotretinoin, doxicycline and erythromycin. Most of these effective acne treatments taken orally are hazardous to a pregnant woman's and her child's health. Only erythromycin is reported to be safe to use for those who are either expecting a baby or breastfeeding.

All acne treatments work by preventing new breakouts, and must be used over a period of weeks or months. Even if you begin to see improvement, continue treatment. Follow the directions on the package or as prescribed by your dermatologist. Even more numerous than over-the-counter medications are prescription drugs and topicals that curb oil build-up, skin cell shedding and bacteria growth - all while drying and peeling away old acne and stimulating healthy skin growth. In cases of unresponsive or severe acne, isotretinoin (Accutane) may be used. Talk to your dermatologist to find out what is appropriate for your case of acne. To avoid scarring, you should never pick or squeeze acne, especially inflammatory acne or “pustules”.

Understanding the Causes of Adult Onset Acne In reality, the primary causes of acne in adults are not all that different from what causes acne in children and teenagers. Indeed, in some instances when it comes to trying to trace the exact cause of adult acne, the task can be rather difficult as it is with younger people, including teenagers. In many instances there can be multiple reasons why a person becomes afflicted with acne as an adult. In some instances, an adult experiences an outbreak of acne due to improper skincare efforts. A person in such a situation is not properly cleansing and treating his or her skin on a daily basis. As a result, oils and dirt can build up on the skin causing there to be an outbreak of acne. Additionally, there is some evidence to suggest that diet can play a role in the onset and development of acne in adults. There are a significant number of myths associated with foods and acne. However, the bottom line is that if a person does not eat a healthy and well balanced diet on a regular basis, he or she become more prone to the possibility of becoming afflicted with acne. Stress has been demonstrated to be a cause of acne in some men and women. Of course, stress can have a number of different negative consequences if it is not properly dealt with in an effective manner. On occasion, a person develops adult acne in response to different environmental conditions. In this regard, many people overlook the fact that their very homes can be the sites of contaminants in the air and in other areas that can result in different problematic conditions, including adult onset acne.

Additionally, ZENMED™ Derma Cleanse® has been demonstrated to be effective in preventing acne outbreaks on the first instance. The Necessity of Exfoliation In addition to making certain that a person utilizes an effective skin cleansing product on a regular basis, that person will also want to make certain that he or she regular exfoliates the skin. Exfoliation is vital for the removal of dead skin cells, dirt, debris and oils that otherwise can accumulate on the and in the skin. By not regularly exfoliating, these waste products can accumulate on the skin, clogging the pores and then establishing an environment ripe for an acne outbreak.

Unfortunately, there is a wide array of different products on the market that are not in fact effective in the care and treatment of an acne condition.

Acne, the dreaded symptom that manifests itself as pimples or zits, is scientifically called Acne vulgaris.

Sure, there are a wide array of them available in the marketplace to help you choose from, but truth be told, acne is not a permanent condition and acne cures that work actually exist. Before one starts looking at available acne cures, it might be a good idea to try and understand what causes acne in the first place. Contrary to popular belief, acne is not caused by bad facial hygiene. Nearly everyone believes this though and any acne cures, that stem from this belief are unlikely to work. What does cause acne however is hormonal changes in the body that result in the production of excessive oil from the sebaceous glands. In some other cases, acne is caused when the pores are blocked or when the sebaceous glad itself is a victim of some infection. In order to work, acne cures must first target the underlying problem. An acne cure that targets the infection of the sebaceous glad for instance is unlikely to work in a case when the acne is a direct result of hair duct blockage. Like with any other illness, acne cures too must target and work on the root cause of the problem. There are several kinds of acne cures available in the market. First, there are topical acne cures. These usually comprise some creams or lotions that can be applied directly to the affected area. These kinds of acne cures normally include topical antibiotics, glycolic acid, lactic acid and gluconic acid. In some cases, such acne cures might also involve an active ingredient like azelaic acid cream and in cases where the acne is severe, accutane and sotret might be active components. Apart from the topical, there are also several oral acne cures available. Most chemists and drugstores have a wide variety of oral acne cures available readily on their shelves. However, before using such acne cures, it might be a good idea to see a dermatologist, who can not only identify the cause of your individual acne, but also prescribe the most suitable treatment for you. A recent innovation in the acne research field has brought to the fore another kind of acne cure. This is laser acne treatment and is becoming increasingly popular as the results have proven to be spectacular.

Though the tea tree oil worked more slowly to clear acne, it produced fewer side effects. Sandalwood essential oil has been shown to inhibit growth of a type of bacteria that is commonly a cause of acne. It is thought that a specific component of sandalwood essential oil, farnesol, is responsible for antibacterial and antifungal activity. Other essential oils containing farnesol include jasmine, palmarosa, and ylang ylang. These essential oils may also be effective against acne. Make your own aromatherapy acne wash by adding up to 5% of the essential oils mentioned above to unscented face or body wash. For an aromatherapy acne gel, use pure aloe vera gel as a base, and add up to 5% of the essential oils mentioned above. Be sure to avoid getting essential oils in or near the eyes. Also beware that because there are many products that contain tea tree oil, the risk of sensitization is increased due to increased exposure.

Vitamin B6, or Pyridoxine is important for the correct function of your immune system and antibody production. Vitamin C with biofavonoids is also referred to as the “super vitamin\" and can play an important role in your acne remedy. Vitamin C is instrumental in at least 300 metabolic functions in your body, is needed for tissue growth and repair, and flushes toxins from your system. Vitamin C also improves immunity and protects against infection. If you have diabetes, check with your doctor for the dosage that is best for your body. Chromium, widely used for weight loss also helps fight acne. Chromium should be taken in an added form since chromium in foods is not easily absorbed. Much of it is lost in processing and high doses of sugar cause the loss of chromium. Zinc aids in acne remedy by regulating the activity of the oil glands. It promotes the healing in tissues and helps to prevent scarring. Zinc promotes a healthier immune system that in turn aids in the healing of wounds. In addition, a powerful antioxidant that helps prevent the forming of free radicals, or toxins that can harm your body. Finally, Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant.

It should be also noted that taking too much of a vitamin or mineral can also be toxic and dangerous. Read the recommended dosage and stick with it. With enough vitamins for your body, you are assured of a well nourished body. Your body organs, cells and tissues can perform optimally on the inside and you get to see the benefits on a physical level.

They usually appear during puberty because of abnormal response of the body to the male hormone known as testosterone. Causes Until now, the causes of acne are still being investigated. However, scientific studies show that it can be hereditary. Other factors linked to zits are the following 1. Skin irritation. 2. Use of Anabolic steroids. Most body builders are taking these synthetic hormones for faster growth of muscles and bone tissues. 3. Stress that increase hormones from adrenal glands. 4. Exposure to chlorine compounds like chlorinated dioxins. Treatment Most people who are suffering from acne on their teens notice decrease or total disappearance of acne when they reach their early twenties without seeking treatment. However, there are some who are suffering from it for decades. The following are proven treatment against acne. 1. Exfoliation. This can be done through the use of liquid scrub, abrasive cloth, or other exfoliating agents that allow the skin to peel to prevent dead skin cells build-up. This process also unblocks clogged pores. 2. Antibiotics. There are 2 kinds of antibiotics that are being used to treat acne These are topical antibiotics and oral antibiotics. Topical antibiotics are applied directly to the affected area. They are being used to remove bacteria trapped on the follicles. This is more popular compare to oral antibiotics because it eliminates possible side effects like drug interactions or stomach upset. Oral antibiotics on the other hand regulate cell behaviour and reduce oil secretion to unclog the pores. 3. Hormonal treatments. This treatment works best for females. Oral contraceptive pills contains progestogen and oestrogen that can help in reducing acne. Some dermatologists administer an injection containing cortisone directly to a large pimple that reduces inflammation and redness almost immediately. Advanced treatments Dermatologists are now considering the use of laser surgery not only to reduce acne scars but also to prevent acne formation. This can be done by burning the sebaceous gland and follicle sac to induce oxygen that kills the bacteria causing acne. This is recommended to people who are suffering from severe acne. Acne scars Severe acne leaves scars that are very expensive and difficult to treat. Although there are no guarantees that acne scars will be removed completely, there are scar treatments that lessen them. These are the following 1. Dermabrasions. This treatment removes the top layer of the skin using high-speed wire brush making the acne scar less visible. People who are suffering from severe acne will need multiple treatments to get desired results. This can only be done by cosmetic surgeons and dermatologists. 2. Microdermabrasion. The newest technique in dermatology that enhances dermabrasion. This is being done by rubbing tiny crystals on the affected area using suction tool. 3. Chemical peeling. This treatment uses organic acid like salicylic, glycolic, or lactic acid to remove the top layer of the skin so that smoother layer will surface. This is generally painless and does not require anaesthetic. Prevention Several books were introduced in the market stating that acne can be prevented by following strict diet and avoiding dairy products. They also suggest that adequate exercise and proper hygiene can save anyone from acne problem. Acne can be a tough case however, knowing how to keep it away from your face is the strongest weapon you can have to enjoy a beautiful face and life.

However, there are additional external acne symptoms that may enhance the formation of acne or interfere with the healing process of your existing acne on the external level (e.g. the external acne environment). Without handling these external triggers, it will be very difficult for anyone to overcome their acne challenge, especially when the holistic treatment is performed while the individual still suffers from “live” and “evolving” acne. Clogged or very large pores, oily or very dry complexion and bad skin hygiene do not cause acne but they interfere with the healing process of the skin and make your external acne environment more prone or “susceptible” to acne. Taking care of your skin on a daily basis by incorporating simple and easy to follow protocols may not only enhance the healing process of your existing acne it will also balance your skin ph levels, making it smooth, even toned, radiant and healthy looking. Although there are many types of cleansers available for different purposes (exfoliation, clean, medicate), washing your face twice a day using a gentle antiseptic and anti-bacterial 100% natural soap like tea tree oil soap, or Cetaphil soap can help reduce inflammation, swelling and redness and significantly improve the overall appearance of your skin without the irritation, allergy reactions and over-dryness that over the counters like Benzoyl Peroxide can cause. Washing your face should always come after a good 5 minutes steaming routine. After the steaming, follow these 3 easy steps 1. Use lukewarm water to get the soap wet. 2. Apply the soap to your face using your fingertips in a circular motion. 3. Wash your face gently and pat your skin dry using a cotton towel. If your sebaceous glands are producing too much oil (due to hormonal imbalance that should be fixed internally), then you probable have excessively oily skin and large pores. To tackle that problem externally, do not use alcohol and water astrigent, instead use soap like Neutrogena clear pore oil Controlling astrigent or even better apply an all natural mask made of bentonitre or egg whites. An extremely dry skin can also be treated internally through balancing oil secretion protocols and dietary changes and supplementation, including the regular intake of 10 glasses of pure water on a daily basis. As for the external care, applying lots of good quality moisturizer such as 99% Aloe Vera gel while avoiding harsh and un-natural external care products; can significantly reduce your dryness. Warning Excessive washing of the face can cause mild to moderate irritations and increase redness and inflammation, defeating its own purpose.

These may be called whiteheads, blackheads, cysts or nodules.  If you are a teenager you're probably going to get acne. In fact, you could get it even if you're as old as 40 something. While it won't threaten your life, it could upset your life by disfiguring you permanently. Even acne that's not severe could end up doing that. Hormones that change during the start of puberty are the reason you get acne. Sebaceous (oil glands) work overtime during this time in your life. They are generally reacting to androgens, a male hormone. Females have androgens too, though not as men as guys. A sebaceous follicle - a hair shaft inside your sebaceous gland - is the culprit. When you are in puberty the cells of your skin lining these sebaceous follicles start to shed more than when you were younger. If these cells stick together as they shed oil increasingly it probably is going to plug up the opening of the sebaceous follicle. The oil keeps building up, though, and with no way to get out it just makes that follicle swell up. This is an acne lesion. Bacteria exists normally in your skin and one bacterium called P.acnes multiplies more than it usually does if a hair follicle gets clogged. This is irritating to your skin and often inflames it. It can even make the follicle burst which then inflames other skin around that follicle. What results then are acne pimples, nodules and blackheads, commonly referred to as lesions. You may have heard some myths about acne, most of which are probably false. If you heard, for instance, that not having proper hygiene will cause acne, you heard wrong. If you believe this you could end up over washing your face or being too harsh in scrubbing it and you'll make the acne worse. Surface dirt and oil aren't the causes of acne. While you certainly don't want to leave dirt and excess oil on your skin its removal needs to be gentle, with light scrubbing and washing twice a day. Then you should simply pat it dry, again gently. You certainly can try one or several of the over the counter acne treatments or see your dermatologist if the acne is severe or the over the counter treatments haven't worked for you. No matter what you've heard, stress is not an acne contributor. Normal every day stress will not cause acne. While excess stress might take you to a doctor for a prescription to calm you or help you deal with your depression and that medication might irritate your skin, the stress is never the cause for the onset or exacerbation of acne. Of course, if the medicine seems to be the culprit tell your doctor. The third acne myth about acne is that what you eat affects your acne - that things like chocolate or pizza or fried foods can create acne or make it worse. Or that avoidance of such foods will keep you acne free or make it go away. This is not so. Yes, a balanced diet is good for you, but it won't affect your acne. Folks might also tell you that your acne isn't a problem to worry a lot about because it is only cosmetic. Acne, however, can hurt the way you feel about yourself, and it can leave lasting scars both physically and emotionally. In spite of what some people might say to you, that is a serious consequence of acne.

Your hearing professional can help you understand your unique loss characteristics, and explain the models that would best suit your needs. This may involve undertaking a number of hearing test to determine the extent of the hearing loss and most suitable product. Lifestyle It is important to think about you lifestyle and when the hearing aid is to be worn. What are the things you do that are most affected by hearing loss? Does you hearing prevent you from undertaking certain tasks or activities? Does you loss of hearing effect your job? Discuss your needs with the hearing expert who can recommend products which suit your lifestyle . Technology The quality of the sound is perhaps the most important consideration. With advancements of digital hearing aids the quality of the sound can often be fined tuned to suit your needs. Again the hearing expert will be able to help you assess the level of sophistication you need based on a range of issues. Size Hearing aids are now often very small and discreet. However, if your eyesight or dexterity is less than what they used to be, size may indeed matter. As a vey small hearing aid may be to fiddly to control. Alternatively, some new instruments adjust automatically or via remote control. Appearance Hearing aids now come in a variety of sizes, from tiny, completely-in-the-canal models to those that sit behind the ear. Many people are overly concerned about appearance, and it’s wise to remember that others will be far less aware of your aid than you. Most hearing aids are quite discreet. Consider the functionality and improvement in hearing, rather than just appearance. The ear The size and shape of your outer ear and ear canal may also influence your selection of a hearing aid. For example, if your canal is extremely narrow, in-the-canal aids may not work for you. Your hearing professional will help determine which hearing aid options are appropriate for you. One ear or two ears? Two ears are better than one, since binaural, or two-ear hearing, is what helps us determine where sounds are coming from, and to distinguish between competing sounds more easily. If you have a hearing loss in only one ear, you may be fine with one hearing aid. Age- and noise-related hearing loss tend to affect both ears, but your hearing profile for each ear is probably different. If there is a loss in both ears, then you will benefit more with a binaural approach. In addition, some of the benefits of digital technology require two hearing aids. Today, about two-thirds of new purchasers opt for dual hearing aids, and as a group, they report a higher level of satisfaction than purchasers of a single aid.

It’s called a fast and here are the how’s, when’s and why’s so you to can use it to get rid of yours ASAP. ","keywords":" Natural Acne Treatment ","article_body":" I will never forget the day a friend mentioned the use of a fast to me as a means of getting rid of my acne. I owe that guy for giving me my life back-literally. Now, just as he helped me a few years back, Friends, allow me to introduce you to what has been coined by Philippus Paracelsus as “the greatest remedy-the physician within”. This is a fast and for acne, it works. What is a Fast? Quite simply, a fast is simply abstinence from solid food for a considerable length of time in the aim of giving the digestive organs a rest. Not to mistaken for starvation, this practice greatly benefits our overall health and is by far a greater cure of our ills-both physical and mental-than all of the drugs of the medical fraternity combined. There are many types of fasts and for treating acne (and dare I say any health problem-at least in their early and un-fatal stages), they are all quite effective. They include 1. The complete water fast This, admittedly, should be conducted with extreme caution or in a specialized sanitarium if undertaken more than 3 days. 2. The Juice Fast This is much easier for the general populace and can be undergone as long as you feel like it. 3. The Fruit Fast This, well, is really not a fast per se…but when one lives exclusively on SEASONAL ORGANIC fruits for days on end…meaning mono meals (2 at the most ) of only one kind of fruit say Apples in Fall, Melons in summer for a week plus, you will be bound to see the benefits. How to Fast Being radical in nature, fasting must be undertaken with care, however from my experience with it, here are a few tips to hopefully get you started. 1. Prepare yourself for a fast by gradually tapering off of acid-forming aka “junk foods and commence to consuming raw and cooked fruits and veggies to begin a milder cleansing process as these items are the best intestinal brooms for the colon. 2. Every now and again, 3 hours after supper and say an hour or so before retiring to sleep, drink an herbal tea laxative such as “Smooth Move Herbal Tea” during this preparatory stage. 3. Drink 1-2 quarts of unflavored lemonade in the mornings to balance the chemical reactions within the body and to restore it to an alkaline state. 4. Be mentally prepared for the task ahead of fasting. 5. Take things a little easier while fasting or on a mono-diet of fruit. 6. Avoid using microwaves at all costs-can’t go into detail as that is another subject, however, TRUST me. You want to exclude the use of this so-called convenience device not only while fasting put permanently. 7. Taper off a water fast by using the second type (juice fasting) for a few days, then gradually going to the third (mono-fruit fasting), then afterwards you could (like I do most of the time) simply stick to tons of fruit as the core of your diet or include properly cooked roots, steamed or raw leafy vegetables. Whatever you do, just please don’t go back to eating the old junk stuff. To explain why in a nutshell, here are two quotes “You are what you eat” and “Let your foods be your medicine…” Other tips to augment these dietetic suggestions are of course proper hygiene which includes making sure we change our pillow-cases daily, use only one towel (or paper towels) for our faces, steering clear of harsh acne medications (I just use plain cool water and facial massaging) and keeping dirty fingers off the face. I really think options 2 and especially 3 as ways for treating acne (in regards to the types of a fast) are quite easy for any and everyone to do. So why not give it a shot? I can confidently say fasting-just like it did for me-can and will work wonders for your skin and overall health. Here’s to a clearer skin naturally.

If you are an adult female, here are some tips on preventing and minimizing acne outbreaks. ","keywords":" acne, proactiv, proactive, acne, treatment, beauty, tips, skin, care ","article_body":" If you are an adult woman who suffers from acne outbreaks, you have probably often felt frustrated or embarrassed by this condition. Rest assured; you are not alone. Millions of women worldwide who have long since past their teenage years now continue to go through the trials of adult acne today. If you are a woman who feels that all is lost, know that regardless of your situation, there is an acne treatment available for you. Women go through hormonal changes many times in their lives. If you are suffering from a recent acne outbreak, it may be because of hormone changes going on in your body. When the body has a high androgen level, the hormone known as testosterone, it can cause acne outbreaks in the female body. For mild cases, a number of over-the-counter products are available such as Clearasil or Oxy 10. These products often use benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, or a combination of both. These act as an antibacterial cleansing agent and can be effective for less severe cases of adult female acne. For severe or prolonged hormone imbalances, you may consider talking to a physician about hormone treatments. If hormonal imbalance is the cause of your acne, a doctor can help identify and diagnose the problems. Hormone treatments can be effective against even the most severe cases of acne found in women. The treatment inhibits the androgens from stimulating the oil glands, thus cutting down on excessive oil that can cause clogged pores and hair follicles. A blood test and often a prescription for oral medication are required for hormone treatments, so it is only available through a doctor. They can be very effective treatments, however, even to the point of stopping the acne before it even occurs. One last-resort option is a prescription medication called Accutane. It is a concentrated form of vitamin A.  Vitamin A is an effective nutrient that strengthens the protective tissues in the skin. It helps repair and maintain the cells that mucous membranes are made of. It also inhibits the body’s production of sebum, a kind of oil that the body produces in the sebaceous glands. When the body produces too much sebum, the pores and hair follicles can become clogged. Accutane should be used when other treatments have been tried and failed because it has some side effects such as possible complications during pregnancy or birth defects. Another option may be birth control pills. Hormonal pills such as OrthoTryCyclen and Estrostep are standard prescriptions that often help prevent acne outbreaks. They are not always totally effective in clearing up blemishes and at times must be used in combination with other forms of treatment. Again, a physician is the best person to consult with in helping to determine what the best options may be. When taking any kind of hormonal birth control pills, women must remember to follow health restrictions that come with use of the pill, such as not smoking cigarettes. Remember, whatever level of acne a woman has can be treated and helped. The first step in acne prevention is to consult a doctor or dermatologist. If you are ready for beautiful skin, it is very attainable with some effort and care.

There is a lot of myth and misinformation about the causes of acne, this article will help clear the air. ","keywords":" acne, acne control, acne treatment, acne medicine ","article_body":" All of the factors that affect acne are not completely understood. However the main cause of acne is well known. Excess production of an oily substance that helps keep the hair and skin soft is a prime ingredient. This oil is Sebum, during adolescence the amount of sebum produced by your body is greatly increased. This sebum when combined with naturally occurring dead skin cells can block hair follicles which then turn into an acne lesion. Not only will this mixture block pores it also provides a growing environment for bacteria. It is the growth of bacterial that causes what is commonly called a pimple. The male hormone testosterone is what causes your body to create excess sebum. Testosterone is produced by both males and females. During puberty the increase of testosterone causes the body to have an abnormal reaction which manifests itself with the excessive production of sebum. This excessive oil is commonly found on the facial skin, as well as back and shoulders. In most people the testosterone levels have normalized by the time they are 20 and any acne issues will clear up. Recent studies seem to indicate that acne is at least partially hereditary. In many cases though it is not possible to determine why some people are susceptible to it and others are not. Other contributing factors can be; stress, diet, skin irritation, hormonal changes and some medications. When it comes to diet skim milk seems to be a substantial contributing factor. Many people believe that chocolate, dark soft drinks and greasy foods will cause acne outbreaks. There is not statistical evidence supporting any of those beliefs. Acne can also be induced or aggravated by medications such as; lithium, barbiturates, anabolic steroids and androgens. Recent studies of acne may have found another cause of acne, narrowing hair follicles. These narrower hair follicles can prevent dead skin cells from being expelled from the pore. These trapped skin cells then mix with sebum and bacteria on the skin to form the acne lesions. The are several different issues that can cause the narrowing of the hair follicle, excessive shedding of cells within the follicle, abnormal cell binding and water retention. I is commonly believed that you should squeeze a pimple to remove the blocking sebum as well as the bacteria. This can actually make the problem worse by spreading the bacteria to other areas of your skin as well as possibly causing scarring. This scarring if severe enough can be permanent. In reality touching the area that has acne can actually make it worse as you transfer some of the oil from your hands to an area that already has excessive skin oil. Your hands can also carry bacteria which will aid in the spread of the acne. Your hair can also exacerbate the acne problem by adding oil to areas it touches. It is important to keep your hair clean so it will not contribute to the problems. You should also try to avoid wearing hats and sweatbands as they will help trap the skin oils and just cause more problems. "},{"title":" Finding an Acne Blemish Control Product.

Look for botanical ingredients in the list.  Some herbal ingredients that are healing to blemished skin include sage, yarrow, coltsfoot, wild thyme, horsetail, althea (or marshmallow), and balm mint (or melissa).  Aloe vera is a well known skin healer, and is often included in good acne products. Also valuable in a treatment remedy for acne are certain essential oils.  Some essential oils are harsh for skin.

This is not only true of retail products, but prescribed acne cure medications as well. For a recurring or severe case of acne, many sufferers turn to a dermatologist for a more aggressive acne cure. In most cases, a prescribed routine and medication can help to treat acne. In most cases, a follow-up visit will be scheduled so that the doctor may monitor the patient’s progress and determine whether additional steps should be taken to treat the problem. It is very important to avoid aggravating, or disrupting, any and all acne blemishes. Otherwise, the sufferer will face a possible bacterial infection from dirt and/or germs that may reside underneath the fingernail. Many believe that just because their fingernails appear clean, there is nothing to worry about. That’s simply not true. There are many germs and bacteria, which are not visible to the naked eye, that reside underneath the fingernail. This is why an acne sufferer should avoid any direct contact between their hand and the blemish area(s).

Recommended daily doses are included. ","keywords":" flaxseed oil and acne, acne, natural acne treatments, flaxseed oil, omega 3 fatty acids ","article_body":" Whilst there have not been many flaxseed oil and acne studies carried out, flaxseed supplements remains a popular acne treatment, with both natural therapists and acne sufferers. Flaxseed is traditionally used as a natural laxative, providing bulk to the stool as well as lubrication. But flax oil has many other benefits, which derive from its richness in the omega 3 essential fatty acid. Essential fatty acids are so named because we must get them from our diet - our bodies do not make them. They are important for normal growth and development, brain function, and help prevent chronic illnesses like arthritis and heart disease. Essential fatty acids come in several forms, the most commonly known being the omega 3 fatty acids and the omega 6 fatty acids. Omega 6 fatty acids are more common in our Western diets, being found in oils like safflower, sunflower, corn, sesame, and other oils. It is possible to have a deficiency of omega 6 fatty acids if relying only on omega 3 fats, like flax and fish oils, as the main type of fat in the diet. Or if taking the omega 3 fatty acids in greater quantities for a period of one and a half, to two years, to restore an omega 3 deficiency. But the more likely scenario is that an excess of omega 6 fatty acids is being consumed in relation to the omega 3's. Symptoms of omega 3 fatty acid deficiency include dry skin, sticky platelets, and tissue inflammation. Given that inflammation is of particular concern for acne sufferers, it becomes easier to see why increasing the amount of omega 3 fatty acids in the diet remains a popular natural acne treatment. Omega 3 fatty acids can be found in certain types of fish like salmon and mackerel, and flaxseed oil. And as well as reducing inflammation, omega 3's speed up healing - again, important for acne sufferers - and reduce platelet stickiness. Platelet stickiness becomes important beyond heart health when you consider that the blood cells carry the supply of oxygen to cells, including cells in our skin, and the cells that are involved in healing. There are 3 types of omega 3 fatty acids that are significant. These are alpha linolenic acid (ALA or LNA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexanoic acid (DHA). ALA (or LNA, as it is often abbreviated to) is converted into EPA and DHA by the body. EPA and DHA are the forms in which the omega 3's are most easily used by the body. Supplementation with ALA has been found to reduce inflammation and improve dry skin. Flaxseed oil is a very good source of ALA, containing an average of 55% and higher. But to carry out the conversions into EPA and DHA, the body needs to have good levels of zinc, magnesium, vitamin C, vitamin B3 and vitamin B6. The recommended intake of ALA is about 2,220 mg per day. Higher doses are recommended to treat deficiencies, or some conditions. There is no real standard recommendation for acne sufferers simply because not enough studies have been done in relation to acne. But doses of 3000 to 6000 mg per day are used to prevent and treat some chronic conditions.

","keywords":" Foam Treatment for Acne ","article_body":" Whether it's mild or severe, acne can cause teens a great amount of embarrassment about their appearance. \"Acne is not an easy condition to live with,\" said Dr. Jeanine Downie, a dermatologist and co-author of \"Beautiful Skin of Color.\" \"To make matters worse, people spend millions of dollars on over-the-counter products that promise clear skin, but often do not deliver on the promise. That's why so many teens get frustrated and give up because they see little or no improvement,\" Downie said. Acne affects 17 million people in the U.S.; more than 85 percent are between the ages of 15 and 24. The condition is most commonly caused by changes in hormones that occur in adolescence. Visiting a dermatologist is the best way to guarantee that you get the proper diagnosis and treatment. While acne can be stubborn and hard to manage, medications such as Evoclin&#8482; (clindamycin phosphate) Foam 1% are available. This once-a-day prescription delivers clindamycin, the most widely used topical antibiotic, in a foam formulation that is easy to apply, dries quickly and leaves virtually no residue. \"Evoclin offers a welcome relief to acne patients who often complain that some medications are greasy, messy and hard to spread on,\" Downie said. \"The foam formulation is great for large body areas, such as the chest and back, since it is easy to apply.\" Side effects can occur when using any acne product, including Evoclin. Side effects may include burning, itching, dryness or headache. Patients should not use Evoclin if they are allergic to clindamycin or the antibiotic Lincomycin, or if they have a history of colitis.

When something is wrong with the parts (organs) inside, the complaint regarding their malfunctioning is reported through the skin. The digestive organs only react to what we have given to them. Their reporting system is fair and without any blemishes. The combination of rich carbohydrates and protein in great number forces the toxins to the surface of the skin and form acne and pimples. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if you apply some lotion or balm and in the process some pimples disappear, do not think that you have achieved something. A host of other pimples are readying themselves for the attack on the surface of the skin, they may however change the strategy and appear on other parts of the body. Because, the royal battle is going on within, on the part of the affected body. As a natural healing process of skin, the post inflammatory acne changes start surfacing. By adopting some medical and herbal practices you can speed up this healing process. The understanding and knowledge about the type of acne is important in the treatment of acne. Also, constant exposure to the sun can cause severe skin damage and delay the healing of your acne. Thus wear a good sunscreen and be protective to heal your acne. Common skin problems include rashes, acne, blackheads, whiteheads, dry and oily areas, reddish-brown blotches. In acne conditions, skin care is not only its external medication, but we have to clearly understand and be conscious about the food intake– foods that aggravate the condition and foods that benefit. The former are acid producing foods. In the later category come minerals, especially iron-rich foods. To say something about one of the ancient remedies prevalent in most of the Indian households— the juice of raw papaya, being an irritant is useful in several skin disorders, including acne. It is applied with beneficial results to swellings to prevent pus or warts and pimples formation. The juice as cosmetic, removes freckles and brown spots due to exposure to sunlight. It is worth mentioning certain simple aspects and instructions to understand and follow a good acne treatment regime. 1. Avoid tight clothes, they are known to cause body acne by trapping sweat. 2. Use a sun-blocker by wearing a hat. 3. Dab the face dry, carefully. Do not apply pressure. 4. Use make up that do not clog the pores. 5.Think well before buying any over the counter products. Be even more careful, if they are introduced recently in the market. Let your skin not be the experimenting ground for the product. It is better to go by the advice of the dermatologists in these matters. "},{"title":" Frequent Questions Raised About Acne ","word_count":3541,"summary":" This article acknowledge the questions that are frequently asked by people. This also gives the answer of this questions. ","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" Acne is a very common disease. People who have it tend to have similar kinds of questions about it and its treatment. This section addresses some of the common questions asked by people with acne. Please remember that your dermatologist is always the best source of specific information about your individual health issues, including acne. Questions and Answer does follows 1. What causes acne? The causes of acne are linked to the changes that take place as young people mature from childhood to adolescence (puberty). The hormones that cause physical maturation also cause the sebaceous (oil) glands of the skin to produce more sebum (oil). The hormones with the greatest effect on sebaceous glands are androgens (male hormones), which are present in females as well as males, but in higher amounts in males. Sebaceous glands are found together with a hair shaft in a unit called a sebaceous follicle. During puberty, the cells of the skin that line the follicle begin to shed more rapidly. In people who develop acne, cells shed and stick together more so than in people who do not develop acne. When cells mix with the increased amount of sebum being produced, they can plug the opening of the follicle. Meanwhile, the sebaceous glands continue to produce sebum, and the follicle swells up with sebum. In addition, a normal skin bacteria called P. acnes, begins to multiply rapidly in the clogged hair follicle. In the process, these bacteria produce irritating substances that can cause inflammation. Sometimes, the wall of the follicle bursts, spreading inflammation to the surrounding skin. This is the process by which acne lesions, from blackheads to pimples to nodules, are formed. 2. I wash my face several times a day. Why do I still get acne? Many people still believe that acne is caused by dirty skin. The truth is, washing alone will not clear up or prevent acne. Washing does, however, help remove excess surface oils and dead skin cells. Many people use all kinds of products, including alcohol-based cleansers, and scrub vigorously, only to irritate the skin further and worsen their acne. Washing the skin twice a day gently with water and a mild soap is usually all that is required. However, acne is actually caused by a variety of biologic factors that are beyond the control of washing. For that reason, you should use appropriate acne treatments for the acne. 3. Does stress cause acne? Stress is commonly blamed for the development of acne. Stress can have many physiologic effects on the body, including changes in hormones that may theoretically lead to acne. In some cases the stress may actually be caused by the acne lesions, not the other way around! If the acne is being treated effectively, stress is not likely to have much impact on the majority of people. 4. I never had acne as a teenager. Why am I now getting acne as an adult? Usually, acne begins at puberty and is gone by the early 20s. In some cases, acne may persist into adulthood. Such types of acne include severe forms that affect the body as well as the face (which afflict males more than females) and acne associated with the menstrual cycle in women. In other cases, acne may not present itself until adulthood. Such acne is more likely to affect females than males. There are several reasons for this. As females get older, the pattern of changes in hormones may itself change, disposing sebaceous glands to develop acne. Ovarian cysts and pregnancy may also cause hormonal changes that lead to acne. Some women get acne when they discontinue birth control pills that have been keeping acne at bay. Sometimes young women may wear cosmetics that are comedogenic-that is, they can set up conditions that cause comedones to form. 5. What role does diet play in acne? Acne is not caused by food. Following a strict diet will not, clear your skin. While some people feel that their acne is aggravated by certain foods, particularly chocolate, colas, peanuts, shellfish and some fatty foods, there is no scientific evidence that suggests food causes or influences acne. Avoid any foods which seem to worsen your acne and, for your overall health, eat a balanced diet--but diet shouldn't really matter if the acne is being appropriately treated. 6. Does the sun help acne? Many patients feel that sunlight improves their acne lesions and go to great lengths to find sources of ultraviolet light. There is no proven effect of sunlight on acne. In addition, ultraviolet light in sunlight increases the risk of skin cancer and early aging of the skin. It is, therefore, not a recommended technique of acne management, especially since there are many other proven forms of treatment for acne. Moreover, many acne treatments increase the skin's sensitivity to ultraviolet light, making the risk of ultraviolet light exposure all the worse. 7. What is the best way to treat acne? Everyone's acne must be treated individually. If you have not gotten good results from the acne products you have tried, consider seeing a dermatologist. Your dermatologist will decide which treatments are best for you. For more information about the types of acne treatments that are available, and for basic acne treatment guidelines, please see Acne Treatments in the main part of AcneNet. 8. What kind of cosmetics and cleansers can an acne patient use? Look for \"noncomedogenic\" cosmetics and toiletries. These products have been formulated so that they will not cause acne. Some acne medications cause irritation or pronounced dryness particularly during the early weeks of therapy, and some cosmetics and cleansers can actually worsen this effect. The choice of cosmetics and cleansers should be made with your dermatologist or pharmacist. Heavy foundation makeup should be avoided. Most acne patients should select powder blushes and eye shadow over cream products because they are less irritating and noncomedogenic. Camouflaging techniques can be used effectively by applying a green undercover cosmetic over red acne lesions to promote color blending. 9. Is it harmful to squeeze my blemishes? Yes. In general, acne lesions should not be picked or squeezed by the patient. In particular, inflammatory acne lesions should never be squeezed. Squeezing forces infected material deeper into the skin, causing additional inflammation and possible scarring. 10. Can anything be done about scarring caused by acne? Scarring is best prevented by getting rid of the acne. Dermatologists can use various methods to improve the scarring caused by acne. The treatment must always be individualized for the specific patient. Chemical peels may be used in some patients, while dermabrasion or laser abrasion may benefit others. It is important that the acne be well controlled before any procedure is used to alleviate scarring. 11. How long before I see a visible result from using my acne medication? The time for improvement depends upon the product being used, but in almost all cases it is more a matter of weeks or months instead of days. Most dermatologists would recommend the use of a medication or combination of medications daily for 4 to 8 weeks before they would change the treatment. It is very important for patients to be aware of this time frame so they do not become discouraged and discontinue their medications. Conversely, if you see no change whatsoever, you might want to check with your dermatologist regarding the need to change treatments. 12. Would using my medication more frequently than prescribed speed up the clearing of my acne? No--always use your medication exactly as your dermatologist instructed. Using topical medications more often than prescribed may actually induce more irritation of the skin, redness and follicular plugging, which can delay clearing time. If oral medications are taken more frequently than prescribed, they won't work any better, but there is a greater chance of side effects. 13. My topical treatment seems to work on the spots I treat, but I keep getting new acne blemishes. What should I do? Topical acne medications are made to be used on all acne-prone areas, not just individual lesions. Part of the goal is to treat the skin before lesions can form and to prevent formation, not just to treat existing lesions. Patients are generally advised to treat all of the areas (forehead, cheeks, chin and nose) that tend to break out rather than just individual lesions. 14. My face is clear! Can I stop taking my medication now? If your dermatologist says you can stop, then stop--but follow your dermatologist's instructions. Many times patients will stop their medication suddenly only to have their acne flare up several weeks later. If you are using multiple products, it may be advisable to discontinue one medication at a time and judge results before discontinuing them all at once. Ask your dermatologist before you stop using any of your medications. 15. Does it matter what time I use my medication? Check with your dermatologist or pharmacist. If you were taking one dose a day of an antibiotic, you could probably take it in the morning, at midday or in the evening, although you should pick one time of day and stay with it throughout your treatment. With oral medications prescribed twice a day or three times a day, you should try your best to spread out the doses evenly. Some antibiotics should be taken on an empty or nearly empty stomach. For optimal results with topical treatments, you should strictly follow your dermatologist's recommendations. For example, if instructed to apply benzoyl peroxide in the morning and a topical retinoid at bedtime, it is important to follow these directions strictly. If the two were applied together at bedtime, for example, you could decrease the efficacy of the treatment because of chemical reactions that make them less effective. 16. I have trouble remembering to take my oral medication every day. What's a good way to remember? What should I do if I forget a dose? This is a common problem. Many patients try to associate taking their medication with a routine daily event such as brushing teeth or applying makeup. It also helps to keep the medication close to the area where the reminder activity is carried out. In most cases, if you miss a day of your oral treatment, do not double up the next day; rather, get back to your daily regimen as soon as possible--but there may be different instructions for different oral medications. Ask your dermatologist or pharmacist about what to do if you miss a dose of your particular medication. 17. I have been using topical benzoyl peroxide and an oral antibiotic for my acne and have noticed blue-black and brown marks developing on my face and some discoloration on my body. The marks are especially noticeable around acne scars and recently healed lesions. Is this a side effect of medication and is it permanent? It is not possible to make general statements about side effects of medications that apply to individual cases. A dermatologist should be consulted. The facial marks and body discoloration described by the patient in this case do fall within the range of side effects of some antibiotics. Unique patterns of pigmentation are sometimes seen in acne patients treated with certain oral antibiotics—particularly minocycline. The pigmentation patterns that appear may include * Localized blue-black or brown marks in and around acne scars and in areas of previous acne inflammation * A \"muddy skin\" appearance that may cover much of the body * Diffuse brownish pigmentation of the feet and lower legs. The pigmentation side effect gradually disappears after the therapy is discontinued. Any side effect of a medication should be noted by the patient and brought to the attention of the physician. While most side effects are temporary they should be discussed with the physician and monitored. 18. My doctor is prescribing a topical retinoid for my acne. He said a retinoid is a substance related to vitamin A. If the drug is related to vitamin A, shouldn’t vitamin A dietary supplements be helpful in getting rid of acne? Dietary vitamin A is essential to good health, especially vision. It has healthful effects in the skin. Large doses of vitamin A for the treatment of acne is not recommended on grounds of safety. The retinoids and retinoid-like substances used as topical treatments for acne are prepared especially for their potent effect on the shedding of cell lining in the sebaceous follicle. Their use should be monitored by a dermatologist. Dietary vitamin A has multiple health effects in the human body. Vitamin A is essential for good vision. Extreme vitamin A deficiency can result in blindness, usually accompanied by dry, scaly skin. Vitamin A overdose that far exceeds the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of 5,000 IU can have effects nearly as catastrophic. Extreme vitamin A overdose can cause the skin to blister and peel—an effect first seen in early North Pole explorers who nearly died after eating polar bear liver that has an extraordinarily high vitamin A content. Topical retinoids are usually prescribed as a treatment for moderate to severe acne. Side effects are chiefly dermatologic, including redness, scaling and dryness of the skin, itching and burning. These side effects can usually be managed by adjustment of the amount and timing of retinoid applied to the skin. Dose adjustment must be discussed with the dermatologist who prescribed the treatment. 19. Are there any acne treatments specifically for people with dark skin? Are there any treatments specifically harmful to dark skin? There are no acne treatments specifically for use on dark skin. Acne treatments are generally as safe and effective on dark skin as on light skin. Some treatments for acne scars may cause temporary lightening of dark skin. Acne is a common skin disease that has the same causes and follows the same course in all colors of skin. Very dark or black skin may be less well-moisturized than lighter skin. Topical anti-acne agents such as benzoyl peroxide that have a drying effect on the skin should be used under the supervision of a dermatologist. Benzoyl peroxide also is a strong bleach and therefore must be applied carefully to avoid inadvertent decolorization of a patch of hair, towels or clothing. Darker skin has a tendency to develop post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (excessive skin darkening at places where the skin was inflamed). Severe inflammatory acne may result in dark spots. The spots resolve over time; a dermatologist may be able to recommend cosmetic measures to make the spots less apparent until they resolve. Some acne treatments, such as topical retinoids and azelaic acid, may also help fade the discoloration. Removal of acne scars by dermabrasion or chemical peeling may cause temporary lightening or darkening of dark skin in the areas of treatment. Scar treatment should be discussed with a dermatologist or dermatologic surgeon before it is undertaken. Alterations of melanin (dark pigments that give the skin its color) pigmentation such as vitiligo and melasma are not related to acne, but they may be present simultaneously with acne. The diagnosis and treatment of melanin pigmentation disorders such as vitiligo requires a dermatologist with knowledge and experience in treating these conditions. 20. Is acne that appears for the first time in adulthood different from acne that appears in adolescence? Acne has a specific definition as a disease of sebaceous follicles. This definition applies to acne that occurs at any age. However, it may be important to look for an underlying cause of acne that occurs for the first time in adulthood. Current understanding of the causes of acne vulgaris is described in the Main Text section Why and how acne happens. In brief summary, acne vulgaris develops when excessive sebum production and abnormal growth and death of cells in the sebaceous follicle result in plugging of follicles with a mixture of sebum and cellular debris and formation of comedones (blackheads and whiteheads). Bacteria in the follicles—chiefly Propionibacterium acnes, the most common bacterial colonist of sebaceous follicles—may contribute to the inflammation of acne by release of metabolic products that cause inflammatory reaction. The pathogenic events, which cause disease, in the sebaceous follicle are believed to be due in large degree to changes in levels of androgenic (male) hormones in the body—a circumstance usually associated with growth and development between ages 12 and 21. Some acne investigators believe that although this understanding is generally correct, there is more yet to be learned about the causes of acne vulgaris. Acne that appears after the age of 25-30 years is (1) a recurrence of acne that cleared up after adolescence, (2) a flare-up of acne after a period of relative quiet—for example, during pregnancy, or (3) acne that occurs for the first time in a person who had never previously had acne. Acne that occurs in adulthood may be difficult to treat if there are multiple recurrences. Some patients with severe recurrent acne have undergone repeated courses of treatment with the potent systemic drug isotretinoin. Acne flares in association with pregnancy or menstruation are due to changes in hormonal patterns. Acne that appears for the first time in adulthood should be investigated for any underlying cause. Drugs that can induce acne include anabolic steroids (sometimes used illegally by athletes to “bulk up”), some anti-epileptic drugs, the anti-tuberculosis drugs isoniazid and rifampin, lithium, and iodine-containing drugs. Chlorinated industrial chemicals may induce the occupational skin disorder known as chloracne. Chronic physical pressure on the skin—for example, by a backpack and its straps, or a violin tucked against the angle of the jaw and chin—may induce so-called acne mechanica. Some metabolic conditions may cause changes in hormonal balance that can induce acne. Some lesions that appear to be acne may be another skin disorder such as folliculitis—infection and inflammation of hair follicles—that require different treatment than acne. Acne that appears for the first time in adulthood should be examined and treated by a dermatologist. 22. My 15-year-old daughter has what I would describe as a very mild case of acne. She has made it much worse by constant picking and squeezing. She looks in the mirror for hours, looking for some blackhead or blemish she can pick or squeeze. Does she need psychological counseling? Excessive picking and squeezing of otherwise mild acne is a condition called excoriated acne, seen most often in young women. A dermatologist may provide effective counseling. The typical person with excoriated acne is a person—often a young women—who is so distressed with her appearance due to acne that she literally tries to \"squeeze the acne out of existence.\" The acne is often very mild, but the person’s face may constantly be covered with red marks from squeezing, and open sores where lesions have been picked open. The word excoriate means to scratch or abrade the skin. Excoriated acne is a medically recognized condition that should be discussed with a dermatologist. Occasionally giving in to a temptation to squeeze a blackhead is not defined as excoriated acne. Hours in front of a mirror, squeezing and picking every blemish, is a definition of excoriated acne. A dermatologist may be able to counsel the patient regarding a course of treatment in which the patient can participate, but keep \"hands off.\" 23. Can the rate of secretion or the composition of sebum be altered by diet? If it can, shouldn’t alteration of diet be considered a treatment for acne? Diet has never been proven to have a role in the cause or treatment of acne. Dietary manipulation may have a role in the treatment of some scaling diseases of the skin, but not in the treatment of acne. Dietary cause is one of the most persistent myths about acne. Foods, such as chocolate or greasy foods, do not cause acne, but certain foods seem to make some people’s acne worse. The following can bring on or worsen it * Hereditary factors * An increase in male hormones found in both males and females * Menstruation * Emotional stress * Oil and grease from cosmetics, work environment No food has been shown to be effective in preventing or treating acne. A healthy diet is, of course, necessary for good general health. 24. Shouldn't I just try to eliminate sebum from my body? No. When it isn't blocked in your pores, sebum helps keep your skin healthy. 25. Why does acne usually start at puberty? No one knows for certain. What is known is that the sebaceous glands that produce sebum get much larger at puberty than they were before. 26. Why does the skin around a pimple turn red? This redness is caused by the body's inflammatory response. Inflammation is a sign that your immune system is working to fight an infection. However, the inflammatory response doesn't always work perfectly, and can even be the cause of scarring. 27. If my skin turns red, does that mean that I'm going to have scars? Usually, no. Even when there will be no permanent scar, the aftereffects of the inflammatory response can leave the skin red for months, sometimes for more than a year. 28. What are free radicals? Free radicals are byproducts of oxidation in your body. We all need oxidation to occur as part of our life process, but there is concern that the buildup of unrecycled free radicals contributes to many conditions, including skin damage. Antioxidants, including several of the active ingredients in Acuzine, help prevent the buildup of free radicals.

That is not true because natural acne treatment products, such as Green tea extract and Licorice Root Extract, still get rid of the acne before a week but most of the time within a few days. They give no side effect and these natural remedies have been used for sometimes thousands of years and most of these remedies are being used to cure other medical things.

","keywords":" food as medicine, healing diets, healing with whole food, healing food, acne food, acne, home remedies ","article_body":" Annemarie Colbin, in her book \"Food and Healing\", makes the interesting point that diets themselves, even healing diets, are not a cure per se. They do often work, but their route to health is actually a product of supporting the body's own healing processes. Her view on skin conditions like acne is interesting. She sees acne as a result of the regular organs of elimination, the kidneys and lungs, being unable to eliminate all the toxic waster matter that we ingest into our bodies. She sees certain foods, like those that make up what she calls the Standard American Diet, as placing too great a stress on our body's ability to process them, at least if symptoms of ill health are appearing like acne. She has found from her own observations that a change in diet often clears up even the large, purplish types of acne. She found this with her own experiences with acne. Annemarie says it takes about ten days to three months to work. Annemarie describes acne as falling into two main causes in her approach. The first is associated with fat, protein and excess sugar. Here she recommends eliminating foods like milk, cheese, ice cream, fatty meats, nuts and peanut butter. The second category is associated with what she calls mineral-water excess, which is s term she uses to describe all substances taken out of their natural context. She mentions iodized salt, or even multi vitamins or supplements like kelp. This is very much a personal relationship as what negatively affects one person may not do so for another. The link between excess minerals or vitamin supplements relates to Colbin's idea of balance, which is that a living system always seeks to return to balance. Anatomy and physiology textbooks even define the processes of the body that way, and it is certainly a common idea in natural health systems, especially traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Colbin writes that excess minerals and vitamin supplements lead to an increased need for the macro nutrients protein, fat and carbohydrates. Salt is also in this category. The idea is that these vitamins and minerals, taken out of the context of the food itself, will lead to the body craving actual food to create a sense of balance. If we have a multi vitamin at mealtimes, within the RDA, I don't believe this is going to present a problem. Especially given that our foods are often depleted of the range of essential nutrients that they would normally have if they were grown organically and in nutrient dense soils. But it is certainly an argument in favor of approaching nutritional supplements in a balanced way also. Some people mistakenly think more is better. This clearly illustrates it is not.

For some people, they must see a dermatologist to help with this annoying problem.  When they go to the dermatologist for help, they will sometimes recommend a prescribe acne medication to help with the problem. There are many prescription medications that are used today to help treat acne.  Most of them are applied to the skin and are used for mild to severe acne.  There are however, other methods of treating acne from the inside out and those require an oral method of taking the acne medications.  This is important for people that have extensive acne problems that keep getting worse instead of better. There are some dermatologists that use therapy to help control an acne problem for some of their patients.  For this to occur, the acne has to be so severe and intense that there are no other methods of treatment working or if the patient and the acne is not responding to any other form of treatment. There are also acne medications that are taken by mouth.  These are antibiotics that a patient has to take on a regular basis to help control the acne.  The dosage will usually start out high and then lessen as it is becoming effective. There are also injections that can be a form of acne medication.  This is used to treat severe acne and it will help to prevent scarring.  Again this method is used for the people that have acne so severe and no other method of treatment is working to their benefit. A lot of women will use oral contraceptives to help control their acne.  This form or acne medication will affect the hormones in a women’s body and will lessen the chance of them having acne.  This is a great idea for women who have an acne problem and want to take a contraceptive at the same time.  There are some women however, that it has the reverse effect on. There are a variety of different creams and ointments to use for acne medication as well.  These are found both in the store and sold as prescriptions.  The more intense creams and ointments are prescribed and do cost more.   When you have a complex form of acne that is hard to treat, this is when the prescription medications have to be used. It is all up to the person with acne if they think that they should seek professional help for their acne medication or not.  They will know when they can no longer take care of the problem and need to have help.

The processes that cause acne are exactly the same in people with black or brown skin but the impact is altered by the skin pigmentation. Acne is very common and affects about 80 in 100 people aged 11-30 at some time.4 The skin The surface of the skin has lots of small sebaceous glands just below the surface. These glands make an oily substance called sebum that keeps the skin smooth and supple. Tiny pores (holes in the skin) allow the sebum to come to the skin surface. Hairs also grow through these pores. IIllustration showing the structure of skin Illustration showing the structure of skin What causes acne? Acne is caused by the overactivity of the sebaceous glands that secrete oily substances onto the skin. The sebaceous glands of people with acne are especially sensitive to normal blood levels of a hormone called testosterone, found naturally in both men and women. Testosterone in people prone to acne triggers the sebaceous glands to produce an excess of sebum. At the same time, the dead skin cells lining the openings of the hair follicles (the tubes that hold the hair) are not shed properly and clog up the follicles. These two effects combined cause a build-up of oil in the hair follicles. This causes blackheads and whiteheads to form. For some people, their acne does not progress beyond this stage. However in other people, the build-up of oil in the hair follicles creates an ideal environment for a bacterium called Propionibacterium acnes to grow. These bacteria normally live harmlessly on your skin but when this ideal environment is created, they grow. They feed off the sebum and produce substances that cause a response from your body's immune system. This inflames the skin and creates the redness associated with spots. In more severe 'inflammatory acne', cysts develop beneath the skin's surface. These acne cysts can rupture, spreading the infection into nearby skin tissue. This can result in scarring. What makes acne worse? There are a number of things that can make your acne worse. These include the following * picking and squeezing the spots may cause further inflammation and scarring1 * stress can make acne worse in some people, although it is not clear why1, * in women, outbreaks may be affected by the hormonal changes that occur during the menstrual cycle1, * excessive production of male hormones such as testosterone from conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome may be another cause.5 For more information, please see the separate BUPA factsheet Polycystic ovary syndrome * some contraceptive pills may make acne worse. This is due to the type of progestogen hormone in some pills whereas some other types of contraceptive pills can improve acne - see Treatments section below. Your GP will advise you which contraceptive pill to take * some medicines can make acne worse. For example, some medicines taken for epilepsy, and steroid creams and ointments that are used for eczema. Do not stop a prescribed medicine if you suspect it is making your acne worse, but tell your GP. An alternative may be an option * steroids can cause acne as a side-effect Treatment Acne may cause you considerable emotional distress but there is a range of treatment options to help you tackle the problem. No treatment will completely 'cure' your acne. The aims of treatment are to prevent new spots forming, to improve those already present, and to prevent scarring.3 Home treatment It is important to keep spot-prone areas clean, so wash the affected area twice a day with an unperfumed cleanser.1,6 The skin needs a certain amount of oil to maintain its natural condition, so avoid aggressive washing with strong soaps. There are a number of over-the-counter remedies available from pharmacies to treat mild acne. These usually contain antibacterial agents such as benzoyl peroxide (eg Oxy and Clearasil Max). As well as its antibacterial effects, benzoyl peroxide can dry out the skin and encourage it to shed the surface layer of dead skin. Together, these effects make it harder for pores to become blocked and for infection to develop. Benzoyl peroxide can cause redness and peeling, especially to start with. This tends to settle down if you reduce the number of times you use it. You can then build up your use gradually. No home treatments for acne will work immediately. It can take weeks, if not months, for significant effects to be noticeable. If home treatments have not worked after two months, or you have severe acne, you should visit your GP. Prescription medicines Your GP may start your treatment by prescribing a preparation containing benzoyl peroxide. If this does not work, or if you have more severe acne, there are a range of other treatment options that you can either rub onto your skin (topical) or take in tablet form (oral). Topical treatments There are several topical treatments you may be prescribed including those listed below * azelaic acid (Skinoren) is an alternative to benzoyl peroxide and may not make your skin as sore as benzoyl peroxide * topical retinoids (eg Adapalene) are medicines based on vitamin A, which are rubbed into the skin once or twice a day.7 They work by encouraging the outer layer of skin to flake off * a topical antibiotic lotion applied to the skin can be used to control the P. acnes bacteria (eg Dalacin T). Treatment needs to continue for at least six months. Preparations that combine an antibiotic with other acne medication are available (eg Benzamycin which combines an antibiotic with benzoyl peroxide) Oral treatments There are several oral treatments you may be prescribed including those listed below * oral antibiotics (tablets), such as tetracycline, can be prescribed for inflammatory acne. They should be taken daily for around three months, although it might take four to six months for the benefits to be seen.7 The success of this treatment can be limited because the strains of bacteria are often resistant to the common antibiotics. Antibiotics do not prevent pores from becoming blocked so treatment to prevent blackheads, such as benzoyl peroxide, is often also prescribed at the same time * some types of oral contraceptive tablets help women who have acne. A combination of the usual pill hormone called ethinylestradiol with cyproterone acetate (eg Dianette) suppresses male hormone activity so is often used in women with acne * isotretinoin (eg Roaccutane) is a medicine known as an oral retinoid, which also exists in a topical form (see above). Isotretinoin works by drying up oily secretions. It tends to be prescribed to people with severe forms of acne that have proved resistant to other treatments. There a number of serious side-effects of this drug, such as liver disorders and depresssion. You should not take isotretinoin if you are pregnant, as it is very dangerous to an unborn baby. For safety reasons, isotretinoin is only prescribed under the supervision of dermatology specialists. "},{"title":" Going For Acne Laser Treatment?

Common skin problems related to acne include skin rashes; popping of blackheads, whiteheads and nodules in the form of pimples and acne; and formation of dry, oily areas and reddish-brown blotches on skin. Greasy and spicy foods can also cause acne prone skin. Healing of the acne lesion is not the end of the problem. It is the beginning of a new series of problems, to solve which a lot of patience and understanding is required. Repeated trips to the clinic of the dermatologist are necessary thus. The post inflammatory effects caused by acne are part of the skin's natural healing process. Medication and practices in vogue can only help facilitate this healing process. Laser therapy, in the treatment of acne, is still at the kindergarten level. Researchers and scientists in this area are themselves confused a lot, and so far, unable to arrive at definite conclusions. Their problem is also the same as faced by the specialists of acne treatment in other branches of science. No single treatment is right for everyone. Type of skin varies from person to person. The topography and skin texture of each person is different. Therefore, the person who opts for and the person who gives treatment, both have to be realistic about the results, while tasking up the option of laser treatment. Two types of acne patients are likely to opt for laser therapy. One, those who are interested in getting rid of the scars, pimples or whatever it may be, on emergency basis and secondly those who are willing to wait but wanting to have a permanent cure. The typical side effects that go with other systems of acne treatment are applicable to laser therapy as well. The damage is likely to be caused by the laser system that is still in the stage of research and development. Well, no one should be in a hurry to own it. Laser treatment specialists are also fully aware of their own limitations about the present status of this system. Proper skin care will still remain a problem even after you get rid of the unwanted part of the skin. Improved tissue metabolism that will boost the blood flow to pores, causing them to open, is the only answer. e researchers are not themselves convinced about the efficacy of laser treatment, how can your dermatologist advise you to go fort it? Even if he does, you please be guided by what you have decided for you! "},{"title":" Got Acne?  Limit your Dairy Foods Intake ","word_count":603,"summary":" Information on Acne and a study that shows dairy products can cause Acne ","keywords":" Acne, acne cures, acne relief, pimples, zits, blackheads ","article_body":" Many experts estimate that Acne affects 85% of Americans making it the most common skin disorder in the United States.  While it mostly affects teenagers, unfortunately, Acne can carry through to adulthood as well causing self esteem issues for anyone who has this particular affliction.  With so many remedies available, what is an Acne sufferer to do? Dermatologists believe what largely determines whether a person develops acne are genetics and hormonal fluctuations, thus the tendency for it to occur during puberty, pregnancy and menopause. Many folks believe that another contributing factor is chocolate and/or greasy foods, but dermatologists are not quite sure yet.  Continued research has now revealed there is one food group that has now been shown to contribute to higher outbreaks.  The food group is dairy products.  That's right, got milk? A study published last year in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology by a team at Harvard suggests that a diet high in dairy products can increase your likelihood of Acne. The researchers analyzed the habits and diets of nearly 50,000 people, looking especially at what they ate while in high school. Those who drank three or more cups of milk a day, the study found, were 22 percent more likely to experience severe acne compared with those who drank one serving a week or less. Skim milk had the greatest effect. Cream cheese and cottage cheese were also associated with outbreaks, while chocolate and greasy foods were not. The researchers attributed the effect to hormones in milk; other studies have had similar findings. It is interesting to note the wide range of intake of dairy products for this study.  Students who drank three cups of milk a day vs. those who drank one serving a week were the ones who were 22% more likely to experience severe acne.  That is a huge difference in daily intake.  Those in that group suffered “severe” acne. As you know, each person reacts to a specific food or medication differently.  Taking this study into consideration, it proves that diet can have an impact on your acne breakouts. While dermatologists are in disagreement about chocolate and greasy foods, my own personal experience suggested that they did indeed impact my outbreaks.  As an Acne sufferer, you need to monitor your diet to test if certain foods are contributing to your outbreaks.  Our diets and the foods we eat are significantly different that what we ate 25, 50 or 100 years ago.  It is very likely that these changes have contributed to such a high percentage of the population suffering from Acne at some point in their life. So how can you tell which foods are causing your Acne outbreaks?  Start keeping a log of the foods you eat and when Acne outbreaks occur.  While this may sound simple enough, it will require some diligence on your part to truly keep an accurate log.  Pay special attention to foods that are not natural.  For example, it is unlikely carrot sticks will cause an outbreak, but that big bag of Sour Cream and Onion Ruffles might.  I know from my own experience, it seemed like anytime I ate a chocolate bar, I had an outbreak within 1-2 days.  When keeping your logs, pay close attention to these patterns.  If you are a heavy consumer of dairy products, you may want to pay special attention to your intake in this area and modify your diet accordingly.  Make sure to pay special attention to what nutrients you might be losing if you cut back on milk, such as calcium and vitamin D.  As always, consult your doctor and/or dermatologist if your problem persists.

","keywords":" GREEN TEA, ACNE, ACNE CONTROL,natural home remedy, acne treatment,acne skin care,green tea as a natural acne remedy,skin care,acne cure, proactive skin care ","article_body":" Natural remedies have become very popular in recent years.  People have stopped looking at the expensive medications and creams to cure various conditions, and have started looking at remedies found closer to home.  This is, in part, because they are less expensive, but they are also on hand and easily obtained. Acne is a common condition in teens and adults alike, and is no exception to the theory that a home remedy can sometimes be better.  If it's worked for many years, why wouldn't it work now?  One such remedy believed to aid in the healing of acne is green tea. While many teas are fermented, green tea instead, is steamed soon after being picked so as to prevent the oxidation of its leaves.  This helps to retain the active substances the leaves contain.  Camellia Sinensis, or as we know it, green tea extract, contains a high content of Polyphenol, along with other important antioxidants. Green tea can serve many purposes, and it is recommended for a number of reasons.  It acts as an anti-bacterial substance, decreasing hormonal activity.  Since acne is often caused by hormones, which produce excess oil and clog pores, thereby causing blemishes, green tea could be a good remedy for this problem. The antioxidents contained in green tea have been shown as very beneficial to acne prevention because they help the body fight against free radicals that cause cell and tissue damage.  Green tea also has very few potential side effects, especially when compared to other acne products and medications. Because of its advantages, green tea is also used in various creams and other topical products used to treat acne.  When compared with other commonly used acne treatments, it ranked high, because of its natural anti-bacterial properties. Other products containing green tea extract are also sold and developed, and are available as herbal remedies.  It can be purchased as a cream. Green Tea and honeysuckle is often called \"Pimple Tea\" in China.  It also helps your body rid itself of toxins, which helps prevent acne. Green tea is also easily available.  It can be purchased in most stores that carry various herbal and other natural remedies, and can also be bought through many on-line sources.  It comes in the form of tea that you drink, or can be purchased in the form of the cream mentioned above. Drinking green tea will help cleanse your body from the inside out, while applying the topical cream, which goes directly onto the skin, will help cure and prevent acne at the source.  No matter how you choose to use it, it can serve many purposes, and may be a welcome alternative to harsh products or unwanted medications.

This informative article takes a closer look at things you need to know about acne. This information is simple. Make certain you don't let important acne information slip by you. I am sure that every one of you is familiar with acne. Almost all of us got this skin disorder, right? Well, technically known as acne vulgaris, this skin disorder affects millions of people from different walks of life, annually.  Studies have found out that most of the adolescents are the usual target of this disease, although infants and adults are also affected. It is even found out that about 80 percent of the teenagers develop acne, particularly for women. What is acne? According to certain studies, acne varies from quite mild to tremendously severe. It typically forms when the lining of the skin duct as well as the sebaceous glands start to work overtime. With the onset of acne, the lining of the duct actually shed cells which are then transported away to the shell of the skin by the sebum. Once the duct is blocked, it is when the sebum and cells start to amass, forming a plug known as comedo. Once the plug stays below the plane of the skin, whiteheads or \"closed comedo\" occurs. If the plug boosts and pops out of the skin duct, it is called \"open comedo\" or blackhead since the top is dark. As you may know, this is not absolutely dirt, thus it will not wash away. There are a lot of factors that contribute to the formation of acne, but in terms of its real cause, no one is actually certain as to what exactly causes acne to develop or why it starts in adolescence.  However, factor like hereditary top the list. It has long been deemed as the most important factor that plays a large role in the acne's development. As what most people believe, if a member of your family had acne, there is a great possibility that you will have acne too. Although acne is very prevalent among teenagers, acne should not control your life. There are a lot of ways to fight acne, and one of those is maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Healthy Lifestyle Changes Experts have said that when treating a person for acne, the only way to obtain results from effective treatments is through various healthy lifestyle changes. When I say \"healthy lifestyle changes\", it includes the way you eat, sleep, work, play, etc. As much as possible, you should try to focus on all areas that need changing. This is very important in order for a sustained effort to be completed. If your goal is to treat your bothering acne, then try to treat your whole self as many ways as possible. Overcoming Stress One of the most common dilemmas that face people is stress. Stress that is not normal. So what happens when the body gets too stressed out? Experts have found out that in this case, the adrenal cortex converts adrenal androgens to the hormone testosterone in both men and women, which in turn results in overactive sebaceous glands. As found out, the ovaries of women are capable of producing 25 percent of the testosterone, while 75 percent of the hormone comes from the adrenal androgens. When the body of both male and female is stressed, more adrenal androgen is released, causing a double amount of testosterone.  It is this doubling effect that causes the T zone of the face to be oily, while other areas are still dry from dehydration. Also note that adult acne is sometimes the by-product of stress and dehydration.  And, water and estrogen are the factors that calm the body's stress alarm system. Now you can be a confident expert on acne. OK, maybe not an expert. But you should have something to bring to the table next time you join a discussion on acne.

There are many types of acne, treatable by even more types of methods. It is important for you to help determine which type your teenager is experiencing to help make appropriate decisions regarding the direction of treatment. New medications have been developed since we were teenagers. What worked for us may not work for teenagers today. The best news is that most common acne conditions can be brought easily under control even if it can not be completely cured. Your teenager is undoubtedly trying everything conceivable to control his/her acne. It is important to remember even if your teen isn't asking for your help, he/she still wants it. Be supportive when approaching your teen, not accusatory. Myths about oily foods, chocolate, or sex causing acne have been proven untrue. Even discussing your personal experiences with acne may help minimize the stressors for your teen, and help \"humanize\" you so he/she is more comfortable discussing it. It is also wise to advise your teenager that most teenager suffer from acne-they are not alone. Of the 85% of adolescents inflicted with acne, 40% of the cases are severe enough to need professional treatment by a dermatologist. Consulting with a dermatologist is prudent toward reassuring your teenager. Although the spots on your teenager's skin are most likely acne, there is potential the condition could be something else. A dermatologist can give you a definitive diagnosis, with as many treatment options as possible. If your teenager has tried a few over-the-counter medications with little to no success, encourage him/her to seek the advice of a dermatologist. A dermatologist may recommend an alternate, prescription-only ointment, lotion, or even oral medication to help clear up the condition and offer relief from physical discomfort. Most importantly, remind your teenager that acne does not last forever. As a teenager nears their early 20s, acne should become a thing of the past.

Find out how they work, and some suggested herbal acne home remdedy combinations. ","keywords":" acne home remedies, acne home cures, acne ","article_body":" Herbal acne home cures can be an effective adjunct to whatever other treatments are being used. It is important to understand that they are not hard and fast 'cures' in the absolute sense, but will instead support the body's capacity to metabolize fats and carbohydrates, and encourage elimination through the lymphatic system. The class of herbs known as alterative herbs are conceptualized traditionally as 'cleansing' the body's tissues. They are thought of as detoxifying herbs, but they don't work in any obvious way on the body's elimination channels. - Namely, the lungs, kidneys, or colon. As such, they do not easily fit into a Western model of understanding the body. However, they do have a long tradition of use, and are certainly worth trying as an acne home remedy. Because they work on the internal condition of the body, they are not going to replace any of the topical, over the counter acne treatments. But they may provide benefit in an indirect way that these acne products don't. Alterative herbs tend to be quite gentle in their effect, so they are best used as a long term treatment. Results won't be sudden, but they will improve the general health of the body. They tend to be given for chronic inflammatory problems, especially relating to the skin, such as acne. These herbs include burdock, cleavers, red clover, figwort, poke root, echinacea, and blue flag. A great combination is blue flag, burdock, yellow dock, and echinacea. These can be mixed together and infused with hot water to make a tea. Drink a cup of this 3 times a day. You can put a little honey in it to make it taste better. Another possible combination is burdock, dandelion, and sarsaparilla (not the cola!). Mix these together when they are dry herbs, and make a tea in the same way. They can be used separately as well. There are a number of options for topical acne home remedies as well. Tea tree oil can be applied directly to breakouts, though for those with sensitive skin this may need to be diluted. Fresh cabbage juice can also be applied directly to acne blemishes, and this may be a better option for those with sensitive skin. An anti inflammatory skin wash can be made from calendula and chamomile. Make a tea as above, then let it cool and keep it in the fridge. Spray or dab this onto the affected areas regularly. Another combination for an acne home cure skin wash is yarrow, elder flowers, and lavender. Colloidal minerals such as potassium phosphate and magnesium phosphate can help support the skin. Zinc is excellent to help prevent scarring, as well as fortifying the immune system, and help supports the normal functioning of hormones. Vitamin C is excellent for encouraging the healing of acne lesions, as well as providing antioxidant support to the immune system. References 1. Simon Mills, The Essential Book Of Herbal Medicine 2.

When delving into non-traditional medicine most are dealing with approaches such as acupuncture, herbal medicines, homeopathic medicine, mind/body medicine, Ayurveda and Kampo as well as dietary and nutritional considerations. The following takes a look at each of these areas as they relate to acne. Acupuncture The use of acupuncture in the treatment of acne has not been scientifically evaluated but there have been reports that two acupuncture procedures have reduced the symptoms of acne auricular acupuncture (acupuncture applied to the ear) and electro-acupuncture (acupuncture using a mild electrical current). Herbal medicine Some herbs are known to have anti-inflammatory properties and, for that reason, they may be helpful in the treatment of acne (as well as other skin conditions) Calendula (Calendula officinalis) German chamomile (Matricaria recutita) Witch hazel (Hamamelis virginiana) Licorice root (Glycyrrhiza glabra) Flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum) and flaxseed oil Tea Tree Oil The herbs that help reduce acne inflammation do so by reducing the amount of the P.acnes bacteria produced by the body as a reaction to clogged pores. Tea Tree oil has been favorably compared to benzoyl peroxide in the reduction of P.acnes and is said to have fewer side effects (stinging, itchiness and dry skin). Homeopathic remedies Homeopathic professionals evaluate the individual (their physical, emotional and intellectual makeup) before prescribing a treatment and then tailor the treatment to the individual. While homeopathy has not had the benefit of many scientific studies, professional homeopaths have found that certain homeopathic treatments reduce certain symptoms of acne Belladonna works best for people who are experiencing “hot” areas on their face or those who have pus-filled acne blemishes. Calendula is used to treat pus-filled blemishes or blisters. Hepar sulphur is useful for pus-filled blemishes that are painful. Kali bromatum is used for deep acne blemishes, especially those on the forehead. Silicea is used for deep, pus-filled acne blemishes. Mind and body medicine Mind and body approaches to the problem of acne are primarily through the practices of biofeedback, cognitive imagery and hypnotherapy. Biofeedback and Cognitive Imagery Biofeedback and cognitive imagery are relaxation therapies used because emotional stress can have an aggravating effect on acne. Biofeedback techniques train the individual to control some internal processes such as heart rate and muscle tension. Cognitive imagery (also called guided imagery) involves the use of mental pictures to relax and evoke helpful physical and emotional conditions. Together, when used properly by a person who has mastered the techniques, these methods have been shown to lessen the severity of acne breakouts. Hypnosis Hypnosis works pretty much the same way that biofeedback and cognitive imagery work, by relaxing the patient. The obvious difference is, of course, in the case of hypnosis, a professional practitioner is controlling the process. Ayurveda Ayurveda is a holistic system of medicine originated in India. Ayurveda focuses primarily on diet and lifestyle. Each person, as we all know, is unique and Ayurveda treatments recognize this by tailoring recommendations to the individual. The practitioner of Ayurveda observes the individual and applies knowledge he or she has learned through ancient texts that document the 'energetic forces' (called Tridoshas) that influence everything in nature -- including, of course, humans. Ayurvedistic remedies tend to be herbal; for example, the one Ayurvedic preparation that has proven best for acne relief, a preparation called “Sunder Vati” is an herbal remedy that consists of Ginger (Zingiber officinale), Holarrhena antidysenterica and Embelia ribes. Kampo Kampo is a Japanese version of traditional, ancient Chinese medicine. A Kampo treatment for acne, the treatment called Keigai-rengyo-to (TJ-50), has proven effective in some cases. TJ-50 consists of seventeen herbs that have combined anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties. Among there herbs are Skullcap root (Scutellaria lateriflora), Licorice root (Glycyrrhiza glabra), Mint (Mentha arvensis), Angelica root (Angelica archangelica), Peony root (Paeonia lactiflora). Nutrition and Dietary Supplements It has been pretty well proven that, at least as a general proposition, diet has no effect on acne but there are certain foods that effect certain people in certain ways. There are many reports from individual acne sufferers that certain drinks or foods (it seems that nuts are particularly suspect) make their acne worse. All that can be said about this is pay attention to what you eat and how it affects you over the next few days.

This skin condition is prevalent in almost 80% of women and 90% of men. ","keywords":" acne, skin care ","article_body":" Age is really not a factor especially in a changing environment. Today, more and more adults are being diagnosed with what we call the adult acne but there is nothing to really fear because it is not a dreaded disease, it is just a skin condition almost like a passing phase in life.

The Herbal Mix Herbs play an important role in preventing and treating of acne. Hence you can take herbs even when you are on a diet or after you have completed your diet program. A good herbal mix should consist of equal parts of herbal extracts from yellow dock, sarsaparilla, cleavers and burdock. These herbs are potent lymph and blood cleansing agents. If you take half a teaspoon at least three times a day apart from a healthy diet then you will not only have a healthy skin but also prevent acne. Some of the most commonly prescribed herbs are tea tree oil, which is applied to acne lesions to kill the acne causing bacteria and Nigella or fennel flower. HERB#1 TREE TEA OIL Tea tree oil is can be obtained from the leaves of Melaleuca alternifolia by using steam distillation. It is the native herb of Australia and effectively fights acne. You can purchase undiluted or pure tea tree oil from health stores. * Ingredients Contains terpinen-4-ol, which has antimicrobial properties. * Use It kills bacteria hence should be used on acne lesions to kill Propionibacterium acnes, which is a Bacteria that lives on the skin and causes acne. * Benefits Few side effects as compared to benzoyl peroxide. * Avoid using undiluted tree tea oil as it may cause skin blistering, redness, irritation, itching and over-dryness * Concentration 5% concentration gels should be used.

Some of the common properties of Nigella are * Antineoplastic * Antimicrobial * Analgesic * Anti-inflammatory * Antipyretics Nigella is a potent natural remedy for strengthening the immune system. It is used for treating acne because acne can get aggravated due to a weak immune system and Nigella makes the immune system stronger. Chemical Compounds Apart from the natural diets and applying or intake of herbs, you can also use baking soda to effectively fight against acne. Baking soda is also known as sodium bicarbonate. It is normally available in a fine powder form and is used for leavening food like cake. You can buy it from any food store. On reaction with acid, sodium bicarbonate produces water and carbon dioxide. Sodium bicarbonate works in two different ways, which are Exfoliating agent Acne can flare up anytime and anywhere and the reason it happens is because of clogging of the hair follicles. When your hair follicle gets clogged then the sebaceous glands will start producing sebum continuously, which will cause the hair follicles to rupture. If a bump appears on your skin with the sebum still inside then it is known as a white head but if the bump comes out of the skin then it is known as a blackhead. Neutralize acidic environment Fungal or bacterial infections are also one of the primary reasons of acne. Baking soda in the form of sodium bicarbonate will help in damaging the bacterial cells that help bacteria to grow on your skin. "},{"title":" Holistic Answers to Acne Questions ","word_count":792,"summary":" Learn how tea tree oil combined with medication, diet and lifestyle changes can treat and even cure acne. ","keywords":" acne,holistic acne treatment,acne cure,Kathryn Beach ","article_body":" People tend to think of their skin as a covering, like they think of their clothes, something that covers their bodies to make them more attractive and protect what lies beneath it. Actually, our skin is an organ of the body, the largest organ. One of its purposes is to deliver an oily substance called sebum to the surface of the skin via fine hair follicles, through the openings called pores. This is part of our bodies' cleansing process. The hair, sebum and the cells that line the follicle can form a plug which prevents sebum from reaching the surface; this is the beginning of acne. The mixture of oil and cells allows bacteria Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) that normally live on the skin to grow in the plugged follicles. These bacteria produce chemicals and enzymes and attract white blood cells that cause inflammation. When the wall of the plugged follicle breaks down, it spills everything into the nearby skin – sebum, shed skin cells, and bacteria – leading to lesions or pimples. <b>What is acne?</b> Acne is an imbalance believed by doctors to result from an increase of male sex hormones in both males and females, which causes the sebaceous glands to enlarge and make more sebum. Some research indicates genetics can affect the tendency to develop acne, also using certain drugs or greasy cosmetics. Acne can occur during puberty, pregnancy, or while starting or stopping birth control pills. Acne is most commonly found in teenagers, usually disappears by the 20's or 30's, but has been known to extend into the 60's in some people. Acne is usually not a serious health threat, but it can be accompanied by both emotional distress and physical discomfort. Permanent scarring can result in severe cases. <b>How can acne be treated?</b> Acne, like all chronic health problems, requires a systemic,wholistic approach for its control, and in some cases cure. The goals of treatment are to heal existing lesions, stop new lesions from forming, prevent scarring, and minimize the psychological stress and embarrassment caused by this disease. Treatment options include drug treatment, skin treatments, diet, and lifestyle changes. Any and all treatment should be conducted under the supervision of a doctor. Drug treatment is aimed at reducing several problems that play a part in causing acne * abnormal clumping of cells in the follicles * increased oil production * bacteria * inflammation. Be forewarned, all medications can have side effects. Check with your doctor and pharmacist. Tea tree oil has been proven effective at killing acne bacteria and healing scars, and it won't clog pores, but many acne sufferers are very sensitive to the oil. So start out with a very mild dose. Add only a drop or two of pure tea tree oil to an ounce of pure aloe vera gel, which is particularly soothing and healing to irritated skin. Increase the amount of tea tree oil as you wish. Limited research indicates that tea tree oil applied to acne lesions on the skin may work slower and may also cause fewer adverse effects (skin dryness, itching, stinging, or redness) than do other commonly prescribed acne drugs. The speed of action depends on the strength of the tea tree oil application. Aside from individual experiences of irritation, there are no known side effects from using tea tree oil, but the oil may cause excessive drying of the skin when used with some other drugs that are used to treat acne, such as tretinoin (Retin-A, Renova) or isotretinoin (Accutane). <b>Dietary and lifestyle changes can help</b> There's more to this story; more than can be written in a short article. I will briefly touch on research-based information that supports dietary and lifestyle change to limit or help eliminate acne. Most importantly, your diet will not cause or prevent acne, but if you are predisposed to getting acne, certain eating habits will encourage flareups, other habits will help your body fight the problem. Firstly, eating refined carbohydrates and sugar leads to a surge in insulin and an insulin-like growth factor called IGF-1. This in turn leads to an excess of male hormones, which encourage the skin to excrete large amounts of sebum. Secondly, a diet rich in raw foods and antioxidants means that we consume more nutrients and fewer acne aggravating free radicals. Lifestyle changes eliminate other factors that may trigger or worsen acne outbreaks. These include avoiding oily skin products and grease in the work environment (don't work in a kitchen where foods are deep fried, for example!), pressure from sports equipment and helmets, backpacks, tight collars, or tight sports uniforms; and environmental irritants, such as chemicals, pollution, and high humidity; touching your skin excessively or squeezing blemishes; hard scrubbing of the sking; and avoiding stress. "},{"title":" Home Acne Treatments ","word_count":464,"summary":" Quick home tips for curing acne. ","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" Using home treatments for mild cases of acne can easily be done if you follow a few guidelines. First off, though, it is important to keep in mind that for more severe cases like cystic acne, a consultation with a dermatologist is advised before beginning an at home regimen. However, home treatment of mild to moderate acne can dramatically reduce the appearance of acne on your face, giving you clearer skin and more confidence in your appearance. After you decide that you want to treat your acne at home, it is essential that you are patient for the first couple of weeks. Acne medications do not work in a matter of days, as they need to fight deep below the surface to balance your skin, but after a couple of weeks you should start to see results. The same rule holds for prescription medications, as noticeable results will occur after a couple weeks. One of the first steps to improving your complexion is washing your face thoroughly two to three times a day. Wash your hands with an anti bacterial soap and, using a mild bar soap or acne scrub, thoroughly wash your face for about thirty seconds. Make sure that your bar soap is fragrance and color free as these can clog your pores and irritate your skin, causing inflammation and increased redness of your face. If washing your face is not enough, further measures can be taken for home acne treatment. One of the most common is the use of benzoyl peroxide, which can be found in face wash, bar soap, topical cream or gel. Benzoyl peroxide is typically used once or twice daily, but initially most people should only apply it once a day or every other day to avoid redness and excessive drying. Generally, results will be evident after a few weeks, but if you do not notice a difference by then you should consult your dermatologist for advice. Another popular home acne treatment is salicylic acid. You can usually find this in medicated facial pads and also in some face washes. Salicylic acid prevents your hair follicles from shedding excess skin and clogging your pores, thereby fighting the cause of most acne and blackheads. Whichever home treatment you believe to be best for your acne, always keep in mind that the results are gradual and will be noticeable in a couple weeks. Follow the directions for your product and only use it the specified number of times per day. Also, combining treatments at the same time may cause irritation and excessive dryness to your face, so benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid should only be used one at a time. If you do not notice results for your home acne treatment after several weeks, contact your doctor for further advice.

","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" Over the counter and prescription acne treatments often contain chemicals that many people do not wish to use. Instead, these people search for home treatments for acne. There are many home treatments for acne that actually do work. Here are some things you can try. 1. Apply essential oils, such as Tea Tree Oil, Bergamot Oil, Clove Oil, Lavender Oil, and Rosewood Oil. For sensitive skin, dilute the oil with grapeseed oil. Apply the oil before going to bed at night, then wash it away in the morning with a pure soap, such as Ivory, and clean water. 2. If you are not taking any medications that could cause you to be overly sensitive to the sun, try getting some sunshine everyday. The purpose is not to tan to hide the acne. Instead, the sun actually kills the bacteria, and dries up the sebum oil that produces acne. This is a common home treatment for acne that doesn't cost anything. 3. Acne begins on the inside of the body, not on the surface of the skin. Drink plenty of water - at least eight glasses per day - to help detoxify your body and cure acne. Also eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables. 4. For home treatment for acne, apply an oatmeal mask at least once or twice a week. Cook oatmeal, and while it is still warm (not scalding hot) apply it to your entire face. Allow the oatmeal to dry, then wash it away. You can also use dried oatmeal, dampened - but not cooked - with warm water as a facial scrub to exfolliate the skin and clean the pores. 5. Avoid eating processed foods, and stick to more natural fruits and vegetables. No food has ever been scientifically proven to cause acne, however, if you have a food allergy, the allergy often results in acne. Many people have food allergies, and go their entire lives without knowing it. Don't assume that a food allergy will leave you unconscious on the floor - the allergic reaction can appear in many forms, like acne breakouts. You can visit an allergist for a simple blood test to find out if you have any food allergies. There are many other home treatments for acne, some of which work, and some of which do not work. The important thing is to drink plenty of water, eat fresh fruits and vegetables, get plenty of sleep, wash your face at least twice a day, and take vitamins - especially vitamin A and vitamin E.

But if you check the ingredients of popular medicines for acne you will find that most of them consist of substances found in common vegetables and fruits. Acne is the result of the lack of vital vitamins like Vitamin E, Vitamin A and Pantothenic Acid. Deficiency in these vitamins leads to the growth of bacteria that clogs the skin oil. This in turn leads to acne. Most of the medicines try to replenish the essential vitamins, which can be easily got by filling your diet with vegetable and fruits containing those vitamins. Keeping the skin clean is an important part in the acne treatment. Cleaning the skin with lemon is an effective acne treatment. Lemon is used for several purposes mainly due to the presence of citric acid. The citric acid has several essential properties required to kill the harmful bacteria. Rub lemon on your skin before going to sleep and you will find a clear skin in the morning. Similarly, you can get rid of acne scars by applying tomato slice. Applying garlic on the spots is another effective homemade acne treatment. Mint juice also can remove skin lesions and scars. Other homemade acne treatments include applying the paste of orange peels. This paste cleans the skin and fights harmful bacteria. Application of raw papayas can also bring relief to acne. Daily application of tea tree oil, coconut oil, lavender oil and jojoba oil before bathing for an hour can reduce acne. Including large amount of fruits and vegetables in the diet and drinking lot of water are part of acne treatment. The success of homemade acne treatments depends on the dedication shown by the person. Simply rubbing lemon or tomato for a day will not cure acne. All home made acne treatments should be strictly followed for over a period of time. "},{"title":" Homemade Acne Treatments - How To Do It The Right Way?

Then there are over-the-counter drugs available, which have improved over the years and can bring about immediate results in most cases. But these things are successful in ‘most cases’ and not in all cases. For such exemptions – people who have experienced allergic reactions to medicines or for those the diet adjustments do not work – it is advisable to try out homemade acne treatments. Such acne facial treatments are effective and cheap and one does not need the advice of a doctor to try it out. One of the effective homemade acne facial treatments is cleansing the facial skin regularly using cotton dipped in alcohol. The alcohol not only cleanses the pores, but it also kills the bacteria causing infection. But take care not to over do it as excessive use of alcohol can cause skin irritation or cause the skin to peel off. For somebody having a heavily oily skin, using oatmeal mask can bring about substantive results. This acne facial treatment makes use of a paste of oatmeal and water, which the person has to apply to his/her face twice a day. Keep the paste there on the face for 15-20 minutes and as the oatmeal paste dries up, it starts absorbing the excess oil from the skin. After removing the mask, rinse well with cold water. Another successful homemade acne facial treatment is the facial mask made using honey and apples. In this technique, grated apple is mixed with four teaspoon full of honey and the resulting paste is applied on the face for 10 minutes. After removing the mask, rinse the face with warm water. Repeat the procedure twice or thrice a week. Tomatoes also work wonders for oily skin. Apply mashed and drained tomato on the facial skin for 10 min and rinse well with warm water. For better results, this acne facial treatment must be done everyday at least once. Caution – If you have pimples on your face, abstain from pricking it with your finger nails. Such an act could aggravate the conditions further. If any one treatment acne is not working, try out another; but touching and picking at the inflammations will help neither the person nor the medical condition.

Find out what you should know when you visit your dermatologist, including the questions that you should be asking. ","keywords":" acne treatments, cure, medications, dermatologist, scar, pimples, zits ","article_body":" While a mild case of acne isn't necessarily a serious problem, it's still a good idea to see a dermatologist. They can give you helpful information about what could be causing your acne as well as the best treatments. Plus, there is another skin condition called keratosis pilaris that is sometimes mistaken for acne and a dermatologist can tell you if that is what you're dealing with, saving you the time and hassles of using the wrong treatment. It's a good idea to prepare for your visit with the dermatologist by making notes about your acne - as much as possible. They will ask you about your background - things like how long you've had acne, how you've treated it and what form it has taken (lesions, whiteheads, blackheads, etc.) They might also ask if there is a history of acne problems in your family. Be sure to tell the doctor if you are allergic to any medications. Females might be asked about their menstrual cycle and males might need to tell the doctor how often they shave. You might be given a choice of treatments so it helps to know a little about the options before you make your choice. Antibiotics are one treatment - they're used to kill the bacteria that leads to acne. They can be taken orally or as a lotion or ointment that gets applied directly to the skin. In severe cases, it may be necessary to use both forms. Topical treatments include things like benzoyl peroxide and retinoic acid. They usually come in the form of a gel and can sometimes cause redness and dry skin. In more severe cases of acne, the dermatologist may recommend a physical treatment. This could include removal of whiteheads and blackheads and possibly drainage of cysts. Whatever type of treatment you end up choosing, it's critical that you follow the doctor's directions. Take the recommended dosage - no more or no less. And even if your acne clears up, you need to continue to take the medication for as long as the doctor tells you to or the acne may reappear. Some of the questions you should keep in mind to ask the doctor include - What kind of treatment would work best for my acne? - How long will it take before I see results? - What is the best way to care for my skin? - What can I do to prevent scarring? - Is it okay for me to use makeup? - Does this treatment have any side effects? - How long will I need to take this medication? As acne treatments can go on for some time, make sure you ask any questions you have each time to see your doctor. Being as informed as possible will make your treatment much easier to deal with.

","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" Acne affects almost everyone — more than 90% of all adolescents, nearly 50% of all adult women and 25% of all adults. Crossing gender lines as well as national borders, it's one of the most widespread medical conditions in the world. Yet there's still no cure. But there is hope. While acne is not curable, it is treatable. We now know more about controlling this condition than ever before. The secret to managing acne is prevention — stopping this condition before it exhibits visual symptoms. Once you have found an acne treatment that helps you accomplish this, it's important to stick with it. Even after pimples disappear, you may need to continue treatment to keep new blemishes at bay. It's also crucial to begin treatment as soon as the first signs appear; the sooner you address your acne, the less likely you are to experience permanent damage to your skin. Of course, in order to stop acne, we must first find out how it starts. What causes acne? One of the most important things you can learn about acne is this It's not your fault. Contrary to popular belief, acne is not caused by anything you're doing — what you eat, how often you wash your face or work out — but by a combination of factors at work far beneath the surface of your skin. A healthy follicle A blemish begins approximately 2–3 weeks before it appears on your skin's surface. It starts in your sebaceous hair follicles — the tiny holes commonly called pores. Deep within each follicle, your sebaceous glands are working to produce sebum, the oil that keeps your skin moist and pliable. As your skin renews itself, the old cells die, mix with your skin's natural oils, and are sloughed off. Under normal circumstances, these cells are shed gradually, making room for fresh new skin. But sloughing is different for everyone. Some people shed cells evenly; some don't. Uneven shedding causes dead cells to become sticky, clumping together to form a plug — much like a cork in a bottle. This plug, or comedo, traps oil and bacteria inside the follicle. A plugged follicle The plug traps oil and bacteria within the follicle, which begins to swell as your skin continues its normal oil production. Your body then attacks the bacteria with a busy swarm of white blood cells. The whole process takes 2–3 weeks, culminating in a pimple. An inflamed acne lesion Why me? There is no one simple \"cause\" of acne — the condition is influenced by many factors, many which are out of your control. The regularity with which you shed skin cells can change throughout your life. The rate at which you produce sebum is affected by your hormone balance, which is often in flux — especially for women. Research has also shown that genetics play a big part in the development and persistence of acne, so your family history is a valuable prediction tool as well when considering the various causes of acne. One of the best weapons in the fight against acne, however, is knowledge; if you know what causes acne, it's easier to formulate a good plan of attack. There are five primary culprits contributing to this process. Each of these factors may vary dramatically between individuals. While you don't have control over these factors, understanding them can help you in your search for the proper acne treatment. Acne Causes - Culprit #1 Hormones. For the majority of acne sufferers, the trouble begins at puberty, when the body begins to produce hormones called androgens. These hormones cause the sebaceous glands to enlarge, which is a natural part of the body's development. In acne sufferers, however, the sebaceous glands are overstimulated by androgens, sometimes well into adulthood. Androgens are also responsible for acne flare-ups associated with the menstrual cycle and, on occasion, pregnancy. Acne Causes - Culprit #2 Extra sebum. When the sebaceous gland is stimulated by androgens, it produces extra sebum. In its journey up the follicle toward the surface, the sebum mixes with common skin bacteria and dead skin cells that have been shed from the lining of the follicle. While this process is normal, the presence of extra sebum in the follicle increases the chances of clogging — and can cause acne. Acne Causes - Culprit #3 Follicle fallout. Normally, dead cells within the follicle shed gradually and are expelled onto the skin’s surface. But in patients with overactive sebaceous glands — and in nearly everyone during puberty — these cells are shed more rapidly. Mixed with a surplus of sebum, the dead skin cells form a plug in the follicle, preventing the skin from finishing its natural process of renewal. Acne Causes - Culprit #4 Bacteria. The bacterium Propionibacterium acnes, (P. acnes for short) is a regular resident of all skin types; it’s part of the skin’s natural sebum maintenance system. Once a follicle is plugged, however, P. acnes bacteria multiply rapidly, creating the chemical reaction we know as inflammation in the follicle and surrounding skin. Acne Causes - Culprit #5 Inflammation. When your body encounters unwanted bacteria, it sends an army of white blood cells to attack the intruders. This process is called chemotaxis; or, simply put, the inflammatory response. This is what causes pimples to become red, swollen and painful. The inflammatory response is different for everyone, but studies have shown that it is especially strong in adult women. What can I do? Fortunately, you have options! There are many kinds of acne treatments available today. But first, you should try to determine the type and severity of your condition. Acne, like a person, is highly individual — it can take many forms, and have a highly variable response to treatment. The more you know about your specific form of acne, the more likely you are to find a treatment that works for you. Learn more about the types of acne.

As the media continues to grow, people become more and more self conscious and worry about their looks constantly. Acne is a major cause of low self esteem in many people and this can lead to future problems. There is a huge push in the fight against acne and the high sales of acne fighting products shows this. However, there are a few other methods to help battle acne that should also be considered. Before thinking about treating acne, one should know the basics of it. Although the basic causes of pimples is unknown, what is known is that they are caused by the pore collapsing on itself and preventing the sebum (the oil) from escaping. Causes of acne can range from hormones, diet, biology (genes), vitamin deficiency, and stress. Most often the causes involve a variety of these factors. Since the exact cause of pimples and acne can't be traced and targeted, dealing with the other factors that can lead to acne is the next best thing. Obviously, medication can't help things like biology, hormones, and stress. However, diet and vitamin deficiency are two important factors that should be considered when looking to combat acne. Whenever a person considers taking steps to fight their acne, looking to change their diet and increase their consumption of certain vitamins should be at the top of their list and should always be involved in their battle plan. While there are many vitamins that can all contribute to the vitamin deficiency that can be a factor in causing acne, the main ones are Vitamins A, B, C, E, Chromium, and Zinc. The simple fact is that most people are deficient of vitamins and minerals, most in fact, due to diet habits. In fact, it is estimated that only between 10-20% of Americans actually consume the recommended amount of most vitamins and minerals. Due to this, it is no wonder that vitamin deficiencies led their hand to many problems such as causing acne. You're probably thinking, \"How can vitamins possibly help?\" Well, one important thing to remember is that your skin is the largest organ on your body. Although the outer layer may be dead cells, the skin is still a living, growing, replenishing organ that requires nutrients and case just like any other organ in the body. A lack of these nutrients can cause many problems, one of them being that nuisance acne, and it important to keep the body and the skin well nurtured. No vitamin is a miracle cure that will wipe acne out of your life and be some sort of savior. However, used in combination with other methods of acne prevention and cleansing, vitamins help to flush out the skin and actually promote the defense against acne. Many of the vitamins mentioned are antioxidants and will help to flush toxins and free radicals from the body, including the skin. Other vitamins have antibacterial effects and actually help to fight acne before it starts. Both of these are extremely important factors in fighting and preventing acne. It is also very important to note that any vitamin taken too excessively is toxic and can lead to many negative effects and is very dangerous. Remember, these aren't miracle cures. Fighting acne is not a quick process, it takes time, and taking too many vitamins not only won't clear up the acne any quicker but it also will can cause illness and other problems. Be patient and smart about any vitamins you decide to take.

Since mental attitude and thoughts cannot be separate from the body, thoughts and feelings are also being expressed as acne. Negative thoughts and feelings produce chemicals that are toxic acids.  Just like toxic acids created in the colon, the toxic thoughts need to be eliminated through the 5 elimination channels Acne can be an expression suppressed past traumatic experiences. As a child, when you were exposed to experiences that overwhelm you – constant mental, physical, or sexually abuse, you suppress them.  So now as an adult, as your defense system weakens, you’re not able to completely suppress this information, so it becomes expressed as acne or other skin disorders.  Of course, these suppressed experiences can be expressed as other diseases. Acne can also be related to the emotion of fear or anxiety.  It can also be an expression of holding onto old junkie or unpleasant memories.  It’s a way of holding on to and burying the junkie or toxic memory into your face.  It is these memories that are trying to surface and, in an usual way, asking you to face them.  Many times, you and other people may not want to remember them or deal with them. To deal with them requires a lot of strength and help from a psychotherapist. Stomach Acid Your stomach uses Hydrochloric acid (HCl) to break down protein.  It also has many other functions, *  Kills pathogens and microbes and prevents them from getting into the colon and blood *  Controls the adsorption of B12 *  Controls the adsorption of iron calcium zinc, copper, magnesium and most B-complex vitamins *  Controls the adsorption of vitamin C *  Created indigestion *  Prevents constipation When you have low levels of HCl chances are that you will be susceptible to getting acne.  HCl can be increased by using a digestive enzyme that contains HCl. Pancreatic Digestive Enzymes When the food you eat passes the stomach and enters the small intestine, the pancreas releases digestive enzymes and bicarbonate to help complete the digestive process. The bicarbonate helps to reduce the acid strength in the food coming from the stomach.  The digestive enzymes digest carbohydrates, fats, and protein. When the pancreas loses its efficiency and starts to release less digestive enzymes, less food is properly digested.  This results in more undigested food reaching the colon.  When this happens, the undigested food, if it stays to long in the colon, becomes a source for rotting matter and toxic material.  This toxic material can get into your blood and cause skin disruption such as acne. A healthy pancreas, which provides the necessary digestive juices to digest the food you eat, is needed for healthy skin and for eliminating acne and other skin sores and eruptions. When you have acne or other skin diseases, they are created when there is an in-balance in your body and that includes many different organs and body processes and systems – your thoughts, digestion, liver, kidney, lymphatic system, lungs, and pancreas.

The FDA is also responsible for advancing the public health by helping to speed innovations that make medicines and foods more effective, safer, and more affordable; and helping the public get the accurate, science-based information they need to use medicines and foods to improve their health.\" In 2005 the FDA provided a public draft guidance document to the pharmaceutical industry on the development of drugs to treat acne vulgaris, or acne. The draft guidance document contains the FDA's current thinking on the development of acne drugs and the methods that should be used. Some of the guidance document information is summarized below. At the time of this writing the FDA document had not been finalized. Types of Acne Lesions The two major types of acne lesions are classified as non-inflammatory and inflammatory. Non-inflammatory acne lesions are more commonly known as whiteheads and blackheads. Inflammatory acne lesions include papules and pustules and are more deeply seated in the skin than the non-inflammatory lesions. How Acne Severity Is Rated Currently there is no standardized method for rating the severity of acne outbreaks. Several methods have been proposed, but each has its difficulties. A sample scale for rating acne severity is summarized below, from least to most severe 0 Clear skin with no inflammatory or non-inflammatory lesions 1 Almost clear; rare non-inflammatory lesions with no more than one small inflammatory lesion 2 Mild severity; greater than Grade 1; some non-inflammatory lesions with no more than a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules only, no nodular lesions) 3 Moderate severity; greater than Grade 2; up to many non-inflammatory lesions and may have some inflammatory lesions, but no more than one small nodular lesion 4* Severe; greater than Grade 3; up to many non-inflammatory and inflammatory lesions, but no more than a few nodular lesions (* worsening beyond Grade 4 is possible). Acne Drug Treatment Study Groups Acne drug test groups should be large enough to be statistically significant so that any claims of success and safety can be supported. Test patients are usually recruited during their most severe acne breakouts. Acne drug trials are recommended to be randomized, blinded, multicenter trials, and other requirements will also apply. A control or placebo group should be utilized. Furthermore, those doing testing should recruit test populations that are representative of the age, race, gender, and geographic location of acne patients in the United States. Determining The Success Of Acne Drug Treatments Acne severity is rated at the beginning and end of every test. Photographic evidence and/or lesion counts may also be taken. It is proposed to measure the success of acne medications as either a success or a failure, based on one of these two methods of measuring success 1. Success meaning a rating of clear skin or almost clear (severity rating 0 or 1) within the test period; or 2. Success meaning an improvement of 2 severity grades within the test period. Under this definition, a successful test subject would have a severity improvement from 4 to 2 within the test period, as an example. The Final Decision On New Acne Drugs Several phases of testing are recommended for proposed acne drugs. Studies must be designed to account for effects such as test dropouts. Rigorous data analysis must be performed in conformance with FDA regulations. Only acne drug test data that has been validated and undergone quality assurance testing should be submitted to the FDA for approval. Only through a rigorous and tightly-controlled testing and analysis procedure, followed by FDA approval, can new acne drugs be made available to the public.

Discover how the liver contributes to acne or other skin disorders. ","keywords":" acne, skin, liver, toxins ","article_body":" The liver is responsible for detoxifying the blood as it comes from the colon, lungs, and lymphatic system.  Once detoxified, this blood moves into your entire body to provide your cells with oxygen and digested nutrients. Because you eat, breathe, and create so many toxins, the liver has a hard time neutralizing these toxins.  If you are constipated, this puts an extreme toxic load on your liver, which eventually leads to the excretion of these toxins through your skin and face.  Excessive toxins coming out through your skin can lead to acne and other skin disorders. All cellular wastes, used up hormones, and excess hormones are routed to the liver through your lymphatic system.  Once in the liver, the liver starts the detoxifying process.  If the liver is overloaded with toxins, it will start to store these toxins in its own cells, in the cells of your organs, in your joints, in your skin, or any other place where the body is weak. Hormones, such as androgens that are not neutralized by the liver, can get back into the blood and move into the skin cells where they pile up and cause an over production of sebum that will flow into the hair follicle.  This over production can cause acne. Eating good fiber daily can keep your colon clean and free of constipation.   Fiber can also trap excess hormones and prevent them from being reabsorbed into your blood through your colon walls. If you are a typical eater, then most likely you have been surviving on junk food.  The quantity of toxic chemical and non-food additives that are in the food that you eat accumulates in your colon, your liver, your blood, and in your face as toxins that needs to be neutralized and eliminated. All junk food and processed food is detrimental to your health and to your face.  Once you stop punishing yourself and forcing your body to process toxic food products, you will have a chance of clearing your colon, liver, blood and the blemished conditions of your face. One other thing, when the liver is congested and weak, it does not produce enough bile.  Bile is needed in your small intestine to help digest fat and to promote good colon health.  In your colon, bile helps to activate peristaltic action and thus prevents constipation.

","keywords":" exercise, fitness, weight loss, diet, holiday ","article_body":" The holiday season is undoubtedly a time for rejoicing. Unfortunately, the average adult does a little too much celebrating during this time of year, which leads to extra baggage when the New Year rings in. Festivities that include indulging in extra helpings, snacking on seasonal treats, and little to no workout time all contribute to the increase in dieters in January. So, this holiday season buck the trends and avoid the Seasonal Seven (the average weight most of us will gain between Thanksgiving and the New Year). That’s one trend you don’t want to participate in! Even though this time of year may bring upon additional stresses and challenges, there are ways to find balance and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Though at times it may seem impossible to bypass the season's traditional foods, there are many ways to partake in the fun without increasing your pant size. The festivities don’t have to be eliminated or avoided. You can have a fabulous time while also maintaining your weight and your fitness regimen. Moderation is the word of the season. It’s the secret to achieving a fun but also healthy holiday time. With a moderate approach both to what you eat (or don’t eat) and how much exercise you do (or don’t do), you can avoid packing on weight AND also partake in all the fun of this time of year. So this season, get a head start on the New Year instead of starting January with extra pounds to lose. Here are some tips to help you during those hectic holiday weeks •\tCreate a plan ahead of time. Before the holidays sneak up on you, create a plan for incorporating fitness and good nutrition into your daily routine. Evaluate your holiday schedule and then determine how much time you will realistically have available to devote to working out. •\tIf you work in an office setting be prepared for the deluge of guilty treats your co-workers and other business associates will graciously want to share. Stash your own healthy snacks in your desk so you won’t be tempted to overindulge when your grumbling stomach demands a 300 snack time. •\tDon’t put your fitness goals on hold until the New Year. If you can’t exercise as often during this time period as you normally do, adjust appropriately. Don’t use the excuse that since you don’t have time for your full workout you just won’t workout at all. Instead accept your limited availability and simply reduce the frequency and/or duration of your exercise. It’s much better to cut your fitness time in half than to completely eliminate it. •\tWhen attending a holiday function, try to eat ahead of time to lessen your hunger. If the party is in the evening, eat breakfast, lunch and a snack before hand (just as you would on any other day).  Since you have eaten meals earlier in the day, you’ll be less tempted to go overboard and eat everything in sight. However, if you instead starve all day long attempting to “save up” all your calories for the party, you will be so famished by the time it begins that it will be difficult not to overeat. •\tSchedule your workouts. Mark them on the calendar and set-aside time to complete them. Consider them as important as any other appointment or event you have marked on your calendar. •\tAt holiday dinners, skip the gravy, dressings, and high-calorie condiments. •\tOn days that you really lack motivation or simply do not have time for your complete exercise routine, commit to do just 10 minutes of exercise. You’ll probably end up doing more than that once you get started. Even if you only end up completing 10 minutes, that is still a lot better than zero minutes. •\tWhen at a party, scout out healthy food options rather than doing a grab and run on all the unhealthy selections. For example, vegetable sticks (without dip), fruit pieces, plain chicken pieces, etc. Then move on to some of the less healthy (but yummy) offerings. You will be less likely to overindulge on these foods if you have already filled-up on some of the healthier items. Yet, you will not feel deprived or unsatisfied. •\tExercise at home. You’ll be more inclined to follow-through on your exercise commitment if you don’t have to drive somewhere to do your workout. Plus, you won’t waste any time on driving, parking, the locker room or waiting to use equipment. Working out at home requires very little equipment (it even can be equipment-free) and is quite inexpensive. •\tAvoid wasting calories on alcoholic beverages. The average alcoholic drink contains 150-200 calories per glass. Indulge in just 2-3 drinks and you’ve drunk the equivalent calories of an entire meal. If you partake in these beverages, choose wisely. For example, instead of having a full glass of wine, try mixing half a glass of wine with sparkling water or with a diet soda. This will help cut your calories in half. •\tWhen running errands or shopping, be sure to pack some healthy snacks to have on-hand. Then after you work-up a big appetite, you won’t be tempted to grab something at the mall food court or the fast food restaurant on the way home. •\tDon’t linger at the buffet or in the kitchen. If you loiter in close proximity to all the guilty temptations, you’ll struggle to keep from unconsciously shoveling food into your mouth. •\tFocus on socializing. Remember one of the great things about the holidays is spending time with friends and family. During get-togethers spend the majority of time sharing conversation instead of sharing desserts. Hopefully these tips will help you find a balance between staying fit and also enjoying the fun of the season. Remember, moderation is the key. Have a great holiday season!

Some may face a lot of side effects during pregnancy, while others do not face any.  A major problem faced by women during pregnancy is acne.  It is likely to develop in the first trimester of the pregnancy due to hormonal changes that take place in the body.  The difficult part is that, acne treatment can be frustrating, as it should be kept in mind to ensure that any medication taken to control acne does not harm to the fetus.  Most of the acne treatments are not safe to be used during pregnancy. The over-the-counter drugs for treating acne can even cause birth defects in the baby. <b>Treatments to be avoided during pregnancy</b> <b> Acne treatment which contains Accutane </b>  Studies have revealed that when this ingredient is used, it might be very dangerous to the baby causing birth defects, or in some cases, it might lead to miscarriage.  This ingredient is not to be used even during breast feeding period. <b>Tetracycline usage too is not recommended  </b> Tetracycline is an oral antibiotic used in the treatment of adults and teenagers, but not recommended during pregnancy as it may lead to poor bone development in the baby.  It is also said to cause discolored teeth in them. <b>Medications containing female hormones </b> Researchers are still inconclusive on this subject, which are related with the development of the fetus and the female hormones, certain hormones can be passed on to the baby either during breast feeding or during pregnancy.  But then, it is thought to cause birth defects in the baby.

","keywords":" Acne, Health, Diet ","article_body":" Let’s face it We mostly judge people on how they look. This is a fact that cannot be denied and the reason why almost everyone is obsessed with their appearance. This is also why if anyone suffers from acne, they often go to any length to control this image distorting skin disease. I am saying this from first-hand experience, pimples, commonly known as acne, can literally make you miserable. Imagine having a big bump nestled right on your lower lip with other small bumps crowding your face and all the while you’re talking to someone you keep wondering  “ Is this person looking at the bump…?” Perhaps you may have tried everything from the popular products advertised on TV, to the over the counter drugs at the local pharmacy. Believe me, I have and NOTHING worked, on the contrary, they made matters worse. I tried exfoliating, using a mask, applying astringents, creams. My roommate literally had to yell once “What’s with all this ‘make-up’ like you are a Vegas show-girl?” It would be an understatement to say my experience with acne was horrible. I had just about given up hope and decided to accept the myths that maybe just maybe it was in my genes or as my pastor at the time said “It was God’s will for me…” but, it was right around this time that I stumbled upon an associate whose conversation with me that day forever changed my life-at least in regards to dealing with acne. He asked what I was using to control the acne and if you are a sufferer, you may know the feeling that arises within when someone brings up the subject of your malady. I got defensive and mentioned the product I was using rather snappily. He kept right on and as if sensing my discomfort, assured me he was only trying to help. He introduced me to juice fasting as a therapeutic measure of healing (not the religious practice I thought it was) and also discussed facial massaging and how to properly cleanse the face. I was intrigued by these methods for the following reasons 1.\tThey were natural 2.\tThey cost little or nothing 3.\tThey made the most sense After trying each of the methods simultaneously, within about 3 or 4 days, I was relieved of the acne and even the razor bumps I also had. If felt good to be able to walk into the office and know that the girls were looking at me admirably and it was also a relief to know this horrendous mask was finally taken off me! Years later after learning more about Naturopathy, Yoga and diet, I decided to dedicate a page on my website to offer this free information on how to cure acne naturally to my readers and am now including some of the tips in this article. 1. If you want to control your acne; you must make a change in your diet now. This will not only clear up your skin, but will increase your all around health and well-being. A suggested diet will be a mucus-less diet comprising of raw and cooked Fruits, Leafy and Root vegetables augmented with a fast of some type. Remember the quote by Hippocrates, the Father of Medicine “Let your foods be your medicine as nature heals ALL diseases!” 2. I can boldly say rid yourself of all topical and ingested drugs you are using to control acne as they only- from my experience- make matters worse. 3. Learn how to massage the face. You can type up facial massaging in your favorite search engine or simply view the free instructions and photos on my site. (Thank Goodness for the internet eh…?) 4. Change your pillowcase daily. 5. Steer clear of using microwaves. My anecdote on this device is in the same section mentioned in tip #3. 6. Engage in some form of vigorous exercise. This not only makes you fitter and healthier but aids tip #1 in detoxifying the skin, this being the second most important eliminating organ next to the lungs as stated by Dr. Stanley Burroughs, the author of the Master Cleanser. In applying these steps above, you will definitely notice a drastic improvement in your skin. You too can cure your acne naturally without drugs and expensive visits to the dermatologists; you only need to be shown how. If one way is true, it is the way of Nature.

It’s not most of the time that we have the budget for maintaining a clear and healthy skin. For some people, getting facial sessions or buying expensive anti-acne facial products are just a norm, but for some, its not. But one thing’s for sure, acne outbreak can affect anybody. So for those who does not want to spend tons and tons of money just to maintain a smooth zit-free skin, follow these simple steps that would definitely make your appearance a la Hollywood star. 1. Use facial soaps specifically designed for acne. Nowadays, there are sulfur-based soaps that are made to heal and dry acne fast. Wash your face at least two times every day. First wash should be done in the morning when you wake up and second, at night before you sleep. No matter how tiring your whole day might have been, don’t forget to clean your face before you snooze to unclog your pores of all the pollutants you faced. However, consistently washing your face every now and then can actually trigger the sebaceous glands to create more sebum, thus, making it more prone to acne outbreak. 2. Drink enough water every day. If possible, go on for a juice or water fasting. This is the easiest way on how to cure acne naturally. It is not really a hassle doing so. Offices and schools now have water stations so you don’t need to carry a bottled one when you go to your place of work everyday. Drinking liquids is essential in everybody’s over all health. It is also responsible for carrying toxins out of the body that causes pimple and other acne flare-ups. Although you might need a few trips to the washroom, it is actually worth it. 3. To cure acne naturally is as simple as not picking or squeezing your zits. It is really quite tempting but touching the affected area, especially you have unclean hands, can increase the production of sebum. Once a pimple or blackheads were squeezed, the membranes below the skin are actually ruptured making the sebum spread underneath the skin and causing infection. 4. Try to engage in activities such as yoga, gym trips on any form of exercise. You may eliminate toxins with these activities through sweating. Detoxification is the key. This is not a healthy way on how to cure acne naturally but would give you a fit and stronger body as well. 5. Change you pillow case after two days. Your pillow cover absorbs all the oil and dirt as you lay down on it every day. Keep you sheets clean to prevent reapplication of the grime and oil that would surely result to even more acne outbreak. Acne is just like any other form of disease than can be cured without the help of medicines and drugs or expensive products for that matter. Just follow these simple ways on how to cure acne naturally and you are on to a clear and healthier looking skin.

Having bad acne can lead to shyness, under-confidence and insecurity so any product on the market that promises to solve acne problems is sure to be popular. However, if you are an acne sufferer then there is some good news; when you are in the later years of your life, your skin will be wrinkle-free. This is because acne sufferers have oily skin and these active oil glands will be of great benefit in later years when the skin looses its elasticity. Acne is usually found where the oil glands are more active and where the skin has more pores. The pores are the holes where the body hair comes through, and the oil glands that are around these pores secret sebum. The sebum may be produced in excessive amounts and this combined with any grime that is on the skin, will develop into acne. The other thing to remember about acne is that it will clear up. Most people do suffer with acne when they are a teenager, but the acne will lessen as you get older, and having wrinkle-free skin in the later years in life is a great thing to look forward to! Many people will try an array of products to try and get rid of acne. But you do not need to use expensive toiletries or cosmetics to help acne. There are a few basic things that you can do to help clear up acne and calm the skin down. Firstly start with a cleaning regime that you do everyday. By strictly keeping the skin clean, by cleansing toning and moisturising you will help your acne. You don’t need to use very expensive products for this; just by cleaning and toning your skin everyday should help with your acne. The other thing that you can do to help with acne problems is look at your diet. It is always important to have a healthy diet, and this can be of great importance where acne is concerned. Make sure you have a varied diet and eat an array of all of the food groups. Drinking plenty of water and eating a lot of fruit and vegetables will help not only your health but also your acne. Another great way to combat acne is by doing exercise. Increasing the blood flow to the skin will help with acne, but it is important to remember to keep clean when exercising and shower before and after. If you make these simple changes to your life you will feel the benefit and you will also see an improvement to your acne. Acne can be a real problem but if you do all that you can by changing what you eat and how you exercise you will soon see an improvement in your acne. It’s important to remember that acne does not stay forever, so no matter how bad you think your acne is now, it will get better.

These hormones signal the skin glands to produce more oil. When this oil mixes with dead cells, it can clog pores in the skin and trap bacteria as well. The result is often a raised tissue area characterized by swelling, redness, and pus. These bumps are also known as “pimples,” the symptom most commonly associated with acne. Acne can occur anywhere on the face, neck, back, or chest, and severe cases can lead to social alienation, or emotional and physical scars. Although mild acne can not be entirely prevented, you can take three steps to minimize its impact. Gently Cleanse Your Skin Each day, gently wash your skin with lukewarm water. Avoid scrubbing your face too hard or washing it too often. Doing so can make your acne worse. Also avoid using skin and hair care products that contain excess oil. Instead, use water-based skin care soaps that gently cleanse your skin, such as Neutrogena or Dove. Apply Topical Ointments At least once daily, but no more than three times a day, apply a nonprescription topical ointment to problematic areas. One of the best products is Clearasil because it contains both benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. Benzoyl peroxide works to unplug clogged pores, while salicylic acid helps clear up blemishes by causing the top layer of skin to peel. Products that contain tea tree oil (commonly found in gels, creams, and lotions) or alpha-hydroxy acid are also desirable. However, remember that if you use a product too often, your acne can get worse. So confine your applications to less than three times per day unless otherwise directed by a doctor. Avoid the Following Make sure to avoid the following acts which can trigger acne flare-ups overexposure to the sun, the wearing of tight-fitting items that rub against the skin, excess stress, constant touching of the face, working with oils or harsh chemicals, excessive sweating, hair hanging in your face, or the use of hair care products that contain oils. Also avoid squeezing pimples. Squeezing pimples can result in an infection and/or long-term scaring. While mild acne is annoying, it will eventually pass. Most people will outgrow acne by their early-twenties, so there is reason to be optimistic. Make each of the above steps part of your daily routine, and you should be able to control your acne. However, those with more severe cases of acne should consult a dermatologist. "},{"title":" How to identify the best skin care lotion for you ","word_count":552,"summary":" How to identify the best skin care lotion for you ","keywords":" skin care acne lotions creams ","article_body":" Lotion is a beauty product made from water and oil mixture that is being applied to skin to keep it soft and younger looking. Lotions available in the market today are being used as antiseptics, antibiotic, antifungal, and anti-acne agents. In addition, they are also being used as protective or soothing agents and commonly use to aid body massage. Lotions are enriched with essential oils and/or botanicals to care for the skin. They are specially formulated to leave skin feeling soft and silky smooth. In addition, they beautify, improve tone, and hydrate all sensitive and delicate skin types. When people buy lotion, they must consider their skin type first to get the most appropriate one. Here are some tips when buying skin care lotions 1.    Normal skin. People who are lucky enough to have normal skin can use any type of lotion. These people do not have noticeable blemishes or acne. Their skin is soft and supple. Also, their skin has beautiful texture and pigment and does not have oily sheen. These people can get any lotion available in the market today and won’t have problems keeping their skin looking brilliant and attractive. However, dermatologists recommend lotions that contains Vitamin E, A, and C to keep the skin smooth and soft. 2.    Oily skin. Oily skin is caused by overactive sebaceous gland. People who have oily skin have wet sheen around the chin, nose, and forehead. They also have visible pimples and blackheads all over the face and sometimes on some other part of the body. These people usually have large pores on the face that have greasy feel. To dry out the oily skin, these people must choose a lotion that is specially formulated to regulate the sebaceous gland. These lotions are often expensive compare to other lotion in the market but they usually work. The good thing about having an oily skin is it is not prone to wrinkles. 3.    Dry Skin. Dry skin can be a result of cold weather, genetics, excessive bathing, or allergic reaction. It is commonly rough, scaly, and itchy if not remedied. People who have dry skin are sensitive to cold and heat, they also have flakes on the cheeks, although they are unlikely to develop acne. The secret in soothing dry skin is regular use of moisturizers and thicker lotions. Lotions that are specifically designed for dry skin contain Alpha hydroxyl acids that is being used to exfoliate the top layer of the skin to get rid of dryness. Dermatologists recommend regular use of moisturizer and lotions to achieve soft and supple skin. Skin condition must also be taken into consideration when buying lotion. People who are suffering from Eczema for example must use especially formulated lotion recommended by their dermatologists. Knowing the skin type is very important when getting a lotion that would match the need of the skin. This is a sure fire way in attaining attractive and soft skin. Most skin care lotions in the market today are generally safe and do not have side effects. They can be applied directly to the body as directed. However, if irritation, itching, or redness occurs immediately seek medical attention. Also, do not forget to inform the dermatologist right away about allergic reaction to some substances and skin disorder/infections before trying out new lotions.

Many individuals, for various reasons, do not have health insurance and they are often the ones who are most concerns with the related costs.  Whether you do or do not have health insurance, there are ways to pay for expensive acne treatments if you find yourself carrying the full financial responsibility. An increasing number of hospitals and/or private practice physicians offer a convenient payment plan, which allows their patients to set up a scheduled payment system for their high-cost acne treatments.  This doesn’t usually require a credit check and is not a line of credit, but is rather a way of offering patients a convenience of gradually payment for services after they have been rendered.  This is a privilege that is not available everywhere, but is rapidly catching on.  In order to find out if your physician offers this type of plan for acne treatments, check with the billing office.  There will typically be a schedule set up for payments and it is important not to miss it.  The reason is because, if payments are missed, the physician or medical care facility may revoke your plan and demand payment in full.  In addition, it isn’t likely that you would be granted this same privilege if payments for acne treatments are late or collection efforts must be pursued. If acne is extreme and neither of the above mentioned financial scenarios are possible, consider selling some of your unwanted items around the house at online auctions, yard sales, flea markets, etc.  These are all terrific ways to earn some extra money, which can quickly add up and help you to pay for expensive acne treatments.

This usually occurs in puberty and can continue into adulthood in some cases. There are some measures you can take to prevent acne or at least keep its severity to a minimum · Make sure that you keep your skin clean. Wash regularly. Washing regularly helps to get rid of the excess oil on your skin plus bacteria and dead skin cells that can clog pores and cause outbreaks. · Get the proper amount of rest. Your body restores and refreshes skin cells while you are resting. Teenagers are notorious for not getting enough rest but it is essential in helping to prevent acne. · Don’t squeeze or pick at pimples because this has the risk of producing a more severe infection. · After you exercise take a shower so that the sweat does not contribute to clogging your pores and producing another acne outbreak. This is a very important consideration because many people have a shower many hours after they have finished their exercise, by which time some of the damage will have already been done. The best advice is to exercise at a place where there are shower facilities. · Wear clean white t-shirts to help keep acne off your back. The white t-shirts tend to absorb the excess oils in your skin and will help to prevent acne on your back at least. · Take off any makeup before going to bed. Again, the key here is to keep your pores clear of oil and bacteria and help prevent acne outbreaks. · Don’t use oil-based sunscreen or skin lotions if you have a tendency for acne outbreaks. These will only contribute to the problem. · After washing, you can also use a cleaning solution on your skin containing what is known as Salicylic Acid. Only use a 2% solution. This can be found in some acne cleaning pad products. The most important key to preventing acne outbreaks is to keep your pores clear. Clogged pores are the main cause of acne.

Dermatologists worldwide have been battling acne for years - most of them are consulted after the acne has started. And what they contribute is great expertise, medications, tips on good hygiene, and emotional support that confirms that some acne is a normal part of life. None of this helps the self-esteem or confidence of the teenager who consistently deals with a face in the mirror they don't like. So consider some additional ways to limit the affect of acne in your life. Primarily, take care of your body. What type of food are you eating? How much sleep do you get? Do you wash with a hypoallergenic soap? These considerations are important ones. Food, for example, plays a big part in acne. Consult your dermatologist or online guide for more tips but be aware that fruits and vegetables are great for more than just healthy bones and teeth - they also lead to healthy skin. Similarly, watch your intake of sugar and manufactured products with heavy oil or fat. Another preventative measure is to review and sample Proactiv, Clearasil, and other acne prevention or removal products and see if any of them work for you. Depending on your skin type, the type of acne you have, or how your body responds to different forms of medication, these products may have a selective benefit for you. Finally, take care of your insides. No matter what effect acne has on your outside appearance during your teen years, only you can determine how you feel about your appearance and your looks. I'm not trying to minimize the emotional affect of acne, especially if some of the scars are permanent, but appearance alone is still only one factor that contributes to one's confidence and ultimately their enjoyment of and success in life. If you can regularly look in the mirror and say \"I like myself\" or \"I like who I'm becoming\", acne will never determine your sense of self. Do your best to prevent or reduce acne's affect on your physical appearance, and don't forget to take care of your inner self as well.

Dermatologists often advise the use of such acne products (example Neutragena, Eucerin, Aquanil, Cetaphil and Extra Gentle Cleanser) if your case is severe. They will however, usually discourage the use of rough cleansers and scrubs. Also, vigorous rubbing of the skin is best avoided as these may create further irritation and may eventually lead to more acne. To be able to select the best suitable acne product for yourself, you must learn how to read labels. That is, you have to acquire an understanding of the ingredients of the acne medications. Also, you have to identify which ingredients and which acne products work best for your type of skin. Benzoyl peroxide, a common ingredient contained in most acne medications are effective in reducing the acne infecting bacteria termed as the \"Propionibacterium acnes\". These are known to clog the pores while creating acne lesions. Moderate cases of acne are usually treated with such over the counter medications. Some of these medications also remove dead skin cells, thus preventing the appearance of comedones. They have been highly regarded among experts for decades now and is still rising in popularity as a safe way of clearing acne form the skin. However, the only serious side effect from using benzoyl peroxide is abnormal dry skin. Another acne product that is noted to obstruct the quick shedding of the skin and the clogging of the skin pores is salicylic acid. This does not reduce the presence of the natural oil , but it prevents the formation of lesions in the hair follicles. It is advisable that you continue using these two acne products even after the severity of the skin disease disappears to minimize the likelihood of future acne breakouts. However, over time, it is a good idea to cut down the usage of these products once you have no more acne. The effective ways to determine which product, from the multitude of acne products available, is to distinguish the result of the active ingredients. Take note of what they do to your skin. It is recommended to avoid alcohol and oil-base products as these may either dry your skin extremely or add to the problem of excess oil. As you experiment with acne products, take note which leaves a soft feel and which results to itchiness and irritation. Make it a habit to apply only small amounts at the beginning of each acne treatment. Also, pay close attention to the acne products for which your skin reacts constructively. There is really no way round selecting the best acne product other than understanding what the ingredients in each product are for and through experimenting which works best for your skin condition. In time, after due diligence and careful analysis, you will be able to determine the best acne product for yourself.

Pimple or acne usually appears during puberty, a point in a person’s life when he still has not yet fully developed his confidence. Having acne at that young age limits a person’s social life because he may have bad feelings about showing his face to others. Ultimately, it can destroy a person’s future. It is unthinkable how many people allow their lives to be inhibited by acne when there are numerous ways of treating such skin disorder. A person, or even his parents, should immediately seek treatment for this skin disorder as soon as possible to avoid further damage top the skin. Acne is caused by the secretion of oil that is thickened and leads to the clogging of pores. When the pores get clogged, it can lead to inflammation and infection and then to scarring. While acne is commonly identified with those facial zits, other body parts like the back, neck and chest can also experience acne breakouts. However, most people do not really fuss about these zits since these are located in hidden body parts. Facial acne is however another story since it is the first thing that a person sees. To avoid acne, you have to keep your skin clean and free of oil all the time. Too much oil build up in the skin can cause acne. Some people are more prone to getting acne so they have to be more careful about keeping their skins free from oil build up. People who have acne can resort to topical treatments at first but if it does not work out, then it is best to seek treatment and proper prescriptions from licensed dermatologists. When stronger acne treatments have been prescribed but they do not work, your dermatologist may recommend accutane. This is a prescribed oral medicine which can be effective but its effects can only be seen after a few months of taking it. Whatever you do with your acne, never prick them because it can only add to the bacteria and can result to scarring. Acne treatments that work for other people may not work on you but keep on seeing your dermatologist until you come up with an effective treatment. Do not let acne limit your social life. Get help and get some acne treatment before your acne becomes worse and even more difficult to handle.

","keywords":" diet for acne ","article_body":" According to older beliefs, acne can be caused by excessive consumption of greasy foods and chocolate. Many dermatologists and other skin professionals now say that there is no proven scientific connection between food and acne. However, I prefer to believe that what you choose to put in your body will have a definite effect on your health, including your skin condition. Sugary foods, excessive caffeine, and greasy, fatty snacks—all have a negative effect on our bodies and overall health. Not drinking enough water also does not help in skin repair and formation of new tissue. If your skin is particularly susceptible to acne, having a poor diet will definitely not help the situation. It is known that eating too much sugar and refined carbohydrates can lead to a surge in insulin. This in turn may create a condition referred to as IGF-1, where an increase in insulin creates the production of excess male hormones. Excessive male hormones can create an excess of sebum, the greasy stuff that can clog pores, attract bacteria, and create monster zits. IGF-1 is also believed to cause keratinocytes to multiply, which can wreak havoc on skin. Doctors have consistently warned of the health dangers of consuming saturated fats and trans fats. Saturated fats have an overall negative effect on the body, weakening the immune system, promoting inflammation, and for acne sufferers, perhaps raising the skin's oil production level. To have the best complexion possible, keep your body healthy and filled with good, health-promoting nutrients. You should strive to reduce saturated fats because they promote inflammation, and will not help you in your battle against acne. Certain oils are, however, absolutely essential to your health. These essential fatty acids reduce inflammation, and help promote healthy skin, nails and hairs. Examples here include flax oil, olive oil, and fish oil. You should also ensure that you have an adequate supply of vitamins and minerals on a regular basis. Vitamin A is paramount for promoting healthy skin. Avocados and carrots are excellent sources of Vitamin A. Vitamin B-6, Vitamin C, and Zinc are other important nutrients for promoting a good complexion. Another aspect to consider in terms of diet is your food allergies. Sometimes, people experience severe cases of acne, even if they lead a very healthy diet and have never suffered from severe acne before. In these cases, the cause may be a potential food allergy. If you suspect your acne is caused by a food allergy, begin by increasing your daily amount of water consumption. Then try to rule out the root cause of your potential acne. Common causes of food allergies include dairy products, excess sugar, and certain refined flours and grains. Also, avoid foods rich in iodine, which have been linked to acne. Iodine-rich foods may include salt, liver, cheese, crabs, shellfish, clams, and kelp products. If you consume iodized salt, make the switch to sea salt. If you find dairy products worsening your acne, consider switching to soy or rice milk and cheese products. The only way to prove whether there is a link between your acne and food is first by making definite changes to your diet. Observe carefully and see if you are better able to control your acne through the diet changes. Even if your acne is not caused by diet, you gain in terms of having a healthier and well nourished body. It is likely that your physical appearance will benefit from a body that is not filled with junk food!

How To remove Blackhead.<br> It is highly advised that you should also consult your dermatologist for proper use of these quality tools. However, here we can give you simple technique to use comedone extractor.  Pesky blackhead is a mixture of dead skin cells, oil and bacteria that builds up inside our skin’s pores. Use the same tools as professional aesthetician or dermatologist use to extract blackheads, pimples & clogged pores. They can be exterminated by using a quality professional comedone extractor. First, lay a warm, wet wash cloth on your face for a few minutes. After a shower is an ideal time to extract. Steaming the face or using a hot water compress is strongly recommended to help soften comedones. This will make them much easier to remove. When you're ready to begin the extraction process lay the looped side on top of the blackhead - basically encircling this area with the loop. Apply slow and even pressure lightly until the trapped sebum is forced out of the follicle. The blackhead — oil and all — will ooze up and out of the pore. Do not continue to attempt the extraction if the trapped sebum is not released easily. Applying too much force can cause infection and scarring. When piercing a whitehead with lancet (Pointed end), wait until the whitehead breaks open, then gently roll the tool over the whitehead. Be sure to disinfect the area when finished and clean your tool off with alcohol or hot water. A deep, cystic pimple should not be opened with the lancet. When dealing with deep acne, it's best to visit a dermatologist. A doctor may use a sterile needle, but only after a pustule has formed. Additional treatments depend on the severity of the acne. Remember Never use fingers or suction guns for removing blackheads, that may aggravate skin infections. Some women buy suction guns for blackheads. Suction Gun is made up of plastic, so can’t be sterilized. Suction gun toys never clean the pores completely and deeply, result is that you will get acne and pimples again. Suction Gun may cause broken capillary conditions and is also not very effective. Only the very superficial dead cells and dirt may be sucked away, leaving the condition with no evident improvement. Always use Professional quality tools for your skin rather than buying cheap and lower quality implements.

Whiteheads and blackheads are two forms of comedo. Wherein, whiteheads are deeply situated into the skin layers. How do you know acne has arrived? Observe and take note of red swelling or small lesions on the skin. The skin coloration is on account of accumulation of dark skin pigments called melemin, supported by hardened sebum and other skin debris and particles. Pus filled lesions are termed as pustules. When acne assumes serious proportions, it is called cyst. What is the cause of acne? Very difficult to pinpoint as such. But it is highly probable that some of the causes are, poor diet, stress, weather elements, hormonal imbalance and to some extent, genetic influences. Greasy and spicy foods can cause oily or acne skin. Foods that aggravate acne are acid producing foods. Foods that benefit and help to mitigate the suffering of acne are those containing minerals, especially iron rich foods.

Many people recoup the original health of the skin, without any permanent effects. But many have to suffer disfiguring scars. Topical skin care products and medications can work to some extent, but more efforts and ways and means will be required to find a lasting solution. A combination of surgical procedure and skin resurfacing have to play their part here. There are no other shortcuts or options to it howsoever. The hyper pigmented mark on the skin, when the acne lesion is healed, should not be mistaken as a scar. At this stage, natural healing process has taken over, a post-inflammatory change. The result may not be immediate, nature is always slow, it goes placidly. The time frame for the scar-vanishing trick, may be anything between 6 to 12 months. If, even then the skin reverts to its original color, take it that you are going to be gifted with a permanent scar, and think of redrawing the plans for its permanent removal, in consultation with a dermatologist. There are certain practices and medicines that can come in to play to expedite the healing process of the scar 1. Wearing a good sunscreen is of utmost importance. Exposure to the sun causes damage to the skin and lengthens the process of healing. 2. Skin's remodeling process is amenable to certain tried and tested medicines. They heal up the post-inflammatory changes. One tested medicine is Tretinoin (Retin A-Renova, Avita). 3. Do not pick scabs under any circumstances. By doing so, you are rendering disservice to your own skin. You are interfering with the healing process of nature. By doing so, you are prolonging your own recovery. Be realistic about the results. Do not try to achieve the impossible. Such efforts may cause more damage to the skin. No single treatment is right for everyone and your dermatologist knows what is best for you. Remember, treatment is addressed on a case-to-case basis. No doubt, it is double punishment. Firstly to undergo the pains of recovery from acne and then to be the owner of a scar. Scars are there to remind you constantly and provide questioning room for others. In the ultimate analysis, let the advice and wish of the dermatologist prevail.

Whether this statement holds good in the case of acne has been a topic which has been under rigorous research. Some people believe that certain foods cause acne while others think vice versa. But, it is very much possible that acne may be the result of food allergies in some cases. In such cases, the prevalent notion is that skin acts as an elimination organ. When you eat a food that you are allergic to, a toxic reaction occurs which leads the immune system of your body to set up defenses against it. Thereafter, the body starts expelling out the toxins from the food leading to inflammation on the skin in the form of papules and pustules. According to a research published in December 2002 issues of Archives of Dermatology, certain high-glycemic foods cause acne. These food stuffs lead to high production of insulin in the body, which raises the male hormones. As an effect of rising hormones, there is excess production of sebum in the body which ultimately leads to clogging of pores thereby causing acne. Foods such as grains, milk, processed food, bread, french fries and potato chips are the main culprits in this case. The experts suggest a switch over to a lower-glycemic diet. A lower-glycemic diet would contain the following 1. Cereals that contain bran, barley and oats 2. A lot of fresh vegetables and fruits 3. Lots of water, herbal teas and vegetable juices And a lower-glycemic diet would not contain the following 1. Walnuts, almonds, Brazil nuts, and filberts 2. Large amount of dairy products and milk 3. Sodas and other aerated drinks 4. Potatoes Vitamin B5 is considered to be a very important part of a nutrient rich diet. It is commonly found in foods such as pork, beef, chicken, eggs, saltwater fish, potatoes, wheat and fresh vegetables. The variety of foods is large, but the problem is that 50 % of the vitamin is lost during milling of grains and sadly, the average American diet lacks in fresh vegetables. Diet may not be the particular cause of acne and rosacea but can obviously help in the prevention and elimination of the same. Hot and damp foods such as sugary cakes, cookies, sweets, alcohol, chocolate, fried and greasy food, dairy products, peanuts, coconut products, fats and oils, generally trigger acne. The link may not be direct but it is always advisable to stop the intake of these believed-to-be acne causing foods.

Acne Vulgaris The most common form of Acne is named Acne Vulgaris.  This type of acne can be easily identified by looking at the characteristics of the lesions. -\tWhiteheads  When a pore becomes completely blocked by trapping sebum, dead skin cells, and bacteria, you will notice a white appearance on the surface.  Whiteheads normally will disappear fast than blackheads on your skin.  You should resist the temptation to pop these pimples -\tBlackheads  When are pore is only partially blocked, the trapped sebum, bacteria and dead skin will have slowly drained to the surface of your skin.  The black color is caused by your skins pigment and melanin reacting with oxygen.  Blackheads will normally take longer to disappear than whiteheads.  You should also resist the temptation to pop these pimples too. -\tPustules  You can identify a pustule by a red circle with a white or yellow center.  The pustule will look similar to a whitehead with the difference being inflammation.  Pustules are commonly referred to as Zits. -\tPapules The papule is a red, inflamed and tender bump on the skin with no visible head.  You should not attempt to squeeze this lesion as you may cause or exacerbate scarring. -\tSevere Acne Vulgaris  The sever types of Acne Vulgaris include Nodules and Cysts and will be quite painful.  You should consult your dermatologist for treating these types of acne. Acne Rosacea Acne Rosacea may look very similar to Acne Vulgaris and often causes confusion.  Millions of people are affected by Acne Rosacea, and it mostly strikes people over the age of 30.  It will start to appear as a reddish rash on the cheeks, forehead, nose and/or chin.  You may also notice small bumps, skin blemishes or pimples in the area.  Blackheads are not a symptom of Rosacea.  You should consult your dermatologist if you suspect you have Rosacea, because treatment is often very different. There are other very serious forms of Acne such as Acne Conglobata, Acne Fulminans, Gram-Negative Folliculitis and Pyoderma Faciale.  These forms of Acne are very rare, but they can be disfiguring, painful and have psychological effects.

The media has been irresponsible at times by reporting stories of questionable side effects and in effect “demonizing” this very safe and useful drug. However, the one side effect that is not in any way “questionable” is that Accutane can cause birth defects and therefore cannot be given to a woman who may become pregnant. <b>New Restrictions</b> In an effort to eliminate Accutane-related birth defects, the thousands of Americans who take the acne drug Accutane -- and people who prescribe and dispense it -- must now enroll in a national registry. Under the program, every patient -- men and women -- must enroll in the iPLEDGE computerized registry starting Dec. 31 2006 to receive Accutane or generic versions of the drug isotretinoin. Doctors must register, too, if they wish to continue prescribing the pills. Drugstores and wholesalers also must register in order for the pills' manufacturers to ship them any supplies. <b>Additional Step for Women</b> Women must undergo two tests to ensure they're not pregnant in a laboratory or doctor's office before the initial prescription, and monthly pregnancy testing before each refill. Home pregnancy tests don't count. The doctor must enter the pregnancy test results into the iPLEDGE system, and the woman must buy her pills within seven days. * These women also must agree to use two forms of birth control while using Accutane, and must self-register on iPLEDGE -- in addition to the doctor's initial registration -- to report that they're doing so. There's no way to know if women lie in this step, but the FDA sees it as an additional opportunity to warn of the pills' danger. The last step occurs at the pharmacy. The pharmacist must check the computer database before filling a prescription to ensure that patients followed all these rules. <b>The Scope of the Problem</b> The FDA estimates that 100,000 prescriptions for Accutane and generics are filled each month. Since Accutane began selling in 1982, the FDA has reports of well over 2,000 pregnancies among users (and possibly more that were never reported). The vast majority ended in abortion or miscarriage, but the FDA counts more than 160 babies born with drug-caused defects. "},{"title":" Is Acne Medicine Safe?

IGF-1, a growth factor resembling insulin, can be produced as well. This combination of substances in the body can spike male hormones, which is known to created large amounts of sebum in the skin. Sebum, a thick substance that can build up in the pores of the skin, encourages the bacterial growth responsible for acne.

However, if you have any reason to believe that a specific food is causing your spots, then try cutting that food from your diet for a few weeks. Then attempt to eat that food once more, if you break out in spots yet again, then you could well be allergic to it and just by cutting down that food, you have found yourself a useful acne treatment. Also, foods which are strong in iodine will produce spots. You’ll find that seafood like shrimp is high in iodine, though you’d have to eat an awful lot of shrimp before you broke out in spots! You’ll also find that the growth hormone that’s in most milk (anything that isn’t organic) as been shown in a recent 2005 study to produce hormone production in individuals, and these hormone shifts are known to make some individuals see spots! Our hormones stimulate oil production, which aids in the clogging of our pores, which all leads to acne treatment! If you are using diet to control your acne, then consider starting with a regular skin care treatment, then look to make some diet adjustments. When you are looking to clear up your skin, try sensible things such as a healthier diet and removing suspect foods from your diet. Just remember that there are quite a few scientists who don’t think there is a link between your diet and your skin’s appearance, but it might be a help to you.

There are many people who have suffered from this disorder who would like to tell others about how they can avoid this problem.  But the answer to this question is not a simple yes or no.  Unfortunately, it is much more difficult than that.  This is because there are measures that you can take to help prevent adult acne, but at the same time there are factors that are completely out of your control. While it is not possible to completely prevent adult acne, there are some steps that you can take in order to keep it from progressing. First off, make sure you are familiar with general skin care products.  By using a gentle cleanser that you can pick up at your local drug store, you will be ensuring yourself that your skin is kept clean. One of the things that many people forget about adult acne is that heavy sweating can cause it to flare up.  If you know that you are going to be sweating a lot you will want to make sure that you shower immediately after you are finished.  This will help to prevent outbreaks. Also, you will want to avoid touching your face at all costs.  This may not seem like that big of a deal, but it can definitely make your adult acne worse.  This is because every time you touch your face you are adding oil to it, and also transferring bacteria to the area.  If you can avoid this, you will be able to help cut back on outbreaks. There is no cut and dry way of preventing adult acne.  Your best bet would be to take the necessary measures in order to prevent things from getting worse.  If you do this you will notice that your acne is not flaring up as much, and that your skin is clearing up. If you can't prevent your acne from flaring up, try using the Acne No More system to prevent your problems. "},{"title":" Is Light Therapy an Effective Acne Treatment? ","word_count":574,"summary":" Light Therapy, although in its infancy, has been shown to be an effective treatment against acne. This article attempts to describe the treatment and its effects on the patient. It appears to be a less costly alternative to some of the other acne treatments out there today. ","keywords":" Acne Light Therapy,Acne, Acne Treatment, Problem, Control, Medication, Prevent ","article_body":" Copyright 2006 Tony Buel Light therapy is a great blessing to those that have extreme cases of acne, as they are very successful in treating the condition without costly medications. The improvement of the treatment of chronic acne can change a person's life for the better. Self-esteem is raised and general well being is increased. Depression is lessened as confidence soars with the clearing of the acne infected area. Light wave therapy uses a high intensity blue light. This light kills the bacteria causing the acne and may help dry up the excess oil that is a large part of the acne problem. It doesn't damage the skin as ultraviolet light can. Laser light waves target two factors that cause acne. 1 - They use heat to damage the oil glands that pour out excessive oil 2 - They work on the bacteria that is present in the pores that cause pimples, whiteheads, and blackheads. These treatments cause a minimum of pain and discomfort and promote regeneration of new skin, which is useful to treat scarring. Light therapy for acne is effective to reduce scarring and to treat the active acne as well. Light laser therapy is a localized treatment, safe, and has no adverse side affects. It's been shown to be as effective on acne problems that other medications and treatment have not done. A sample study of 30 patients was made who suffered moderate to mild acne.  They were placed in a clinical trial and within three months, they had significant decrease in their acne outbreaks. The treatment consists of the affected area to short bursts of light called pulse dye laser therapy. Initially used to combat wrinkles it stimulated the production of collagen. It also was used to combat scars from severe cases of acne. Doctors were brought in to look at the clinical evidence and agreed that light treatment was successful in treating live acne. A study that was recently published states that a single session of five minutes can have an effect on acne for up to twelve months. Patients that took part in the study lost over 70 percent of their acne.  One patient's spots disappeared completely. The treatment is being widely used in private clinics and started out to be costly. As with all new technologies, the price has come down and more professionals are using light therapy in treatments for their patients. One patient stated the treatments only take about five minutes, and with each treatment her acne was much less visible. Another benefit of using laser light therapy is that is doesn't cause any discoloration of the patient's skin. Treatment sessions can last from 5 to 20 and the patient experiences a slight stinging sensation while undergoing treatment. A topical anesthetic can be applied before the treatment and the application of ice was used after the treatment. Light therapy is still in its infancy and has only been used in the last few years.  More work is needed to re-confirm any clinical benefits. Imagine the impact on those individuals in economical terms. Instead of continuing drug treatment, occasional light therapy treatments can be a big help who have moderate cases of acne. If you or someone you love were afflicted with moderate to severe cases of acne, it would be worthwhile to look into light treatment. It's non-invasive and works in a shorter time than topical ointments and antibiotics. This may be the best thing to happen for acne sufferers in a long time!

","keywords":" acne, acne medication ","article_body":" You have company -- acne affects almost everyone. It strikes nearly 85% of the population between the ages of 12 and 24. 40% of acne sufferers have breakouts severe enough to require medical treatment. Acne doesn't show favorites. Men and women of all races during adolescence and adulthood are nearly equally prone to acne. Location It's a widespread skin condition characterized by lesions that break out on the skin. The lesions form as whiteheads, blackheads, or cysts because pores get clogged. The so-called 'T zone' of the face -- the nose, the chin and forehead -- are the most common areas for pimples to appear. The back is the second most common area for acne, followed by the neck, chest, and shoulders. Timing Usually acne first attacks during adolescence, most often at puberty because that's when the body starts producing an abundance of an oily substance called sebum. Normally a good thing, sebum keeps the hair and skin soft and lubricated. But during puberty, the body produces too much. The excess oil clogs the pores and leaves the skin feeling oily. Puberty also triggers an excess production of follicle cells. Dying cells quickly build up and combine with sebum to form whiteheads. The oil and dead cell creates a breeding ground for bacteria that creates redness and swelling in the area resulting in pimples. A Bad Image Acne becomes a self-image difficulty for many people because it affects their appearance. Teenagers are particularly at risk as acne can cause feelings of reduced self-confidence and even depression. It causes some to withdraw from social interactions and others become angry and troubled. Most people find their acne has cleared up by the time they reach their 20s. Although for some it can last throughout their adult years. Treatable The good news is there are many modern medical treatments for acne. The first line of defense is to keep the skin clean and oil-free. Do this by gently washing with soap and water twice a day, especially following activities or conditions that cause perspiration. There is a wide variety of medical treatments available, both prescribed and over-the-counter. For serious cases, a dermatologist is needed for advice about nutrition, lifestyle changes, topical medications, and antibiotics that fight the bacteria causing pimples.

","keywords":" Laser Resurfacing, Laser Scar Resurfacing ","article_body":" Laser resurfacing or “laser peels” is generally used to minimize the appearance of fine lines, mainly in the areas around the mouth and the eyes. It is also an effective solution for treating facial scars or areas of uneven pigmentation. Laser resurfacing is performed both on the whole face as well as in specific regions. The procedure is frequent done in conjunction with another cosmetic operation, such as a facelift or eyelid surgery. The benefits of laser resurfacing of skins are ahead of those offered by another skin rejuvenation option. It is the best treatment to ensure overall improvement of chronically photo damaged skin. Skin damage caused by photo aging is presented in various forms like rhytides and actinic keratoses, scarring from severe acne, surgery, or trauma. These are all cosmetic disfigurements posing psychological problems to the patients. Most of these problems can be effectively cured by laser scar resurfacing. The laser resurfacing procedure uses a light beam from a CO2 laser. The idea is to vaporize the upper layers of damaged skin at specific and controlled levels of penetration. A significantly positive side of laser resurfacing is that it produces less bleeding, bruising and post-operative discomfort than is typically seen with other resurfacing methods. <h1>Eligibility for laser resurfacing</h1> Before you proceed for laser resurfacing, you need to consult a doctor to check your eligibility. The consultation will include a careful assessment of the problematic area. Your skin condition will also play a crucial role in this regard. For example, dark skin types are more likely to complications from skin pigmentation after laser treatment. <b>Skin conditions helpful for laser resurfacing</b> A full-face laser resurfacing is likely to produce dramatic result mainly in aged, sun-damaged skin where actinic and seborrheic keratosis, lentigines, and telangiectasias are common. Besides, CO2 laser surgery seemingly gives good results for all scar types. However, laser scar resurfacing is a better option for saucer-shaped distensible areas, rather than pitted scars for which dermabrasion is a better option. Laser scar resurfacing is also a suitable option for problems like atrophic facial scars, hypertrophic scars and traumatic scars, which can also be ablated with considerable improvement of their appearance. Laser scar resurfacing is of great help in blending the scar with the texture and color of the patient's skin. <b>Skin conditions not suitable for laser resurfacing</b> However, laser resurfacing has certain limitations as well. For example, the procedure is not that effective in treating the nasolabial folds. <h1>Risks and uncertainties in laser resurfacing</h1> Handling of laser resurfacing by a qualified and experienced surgeon reduces the chances and level of complications. However, the outcome of the surgery is not completely predictable. The risks you should be prepared for in this surgery include – <b>•\tburns or other injuries caused by the heat of the laser energy</b> <b>•\tscarring</b> <b>•\tobvious lightening or darkening of the skin area that has been treated</b> Sometimes the healing seems abnormal or delayed. Besides, sometimes there is evidence of abnormal pigmentation or scarring. In such cases additional coercive measures and treatment may be required. The risks can be reduced to a great extent by choosing a plastic surgeon specially trained in laser surgery.

By using shorter pulse durations of laser light, the minimizing of thermal damage significantly reduced the risk for scarring on the skin. The latest procedures involve an intense beam of light to destroy the skin tissue instantly. As of now, carbon dioxide and ErYAG laser reportedly offer best acne treatments.

Thus they vaporize the ridges of scars and wrinkles and smoothing out the surface of the skin. <BR><B>Best lasers for acne scar removal </B> Er YAG laser offers the best acne scar laser treatment. The benefit of ErYAG laser for superficial to moderate acne scar removal stems from the fact that this laser produces less thermal damage compared to other types of laser. The short pulsed ErYAG laser has a water absorption coefficient 16 times greater than that of the carbon dioxide laser. The water in the tissue absorbs most of the energy of these lasers. That results in minimal optical penetration depth and thermal damage. The more limited penetration of these lasers into the skin triggers a histo-pathological improvement less pronounced than that of carbon dioxide laser. However, ErYAG laser shows potential as an acne scar removal treatment especially in the treatment of mild to moderate superficial rhytides and scars. In fact it is the best acne scar laser treatment for acne scars that are not very deep.

","keywords":" acne, acne control, acne treatment, acne medicine ","article_body":" Acne is in most cases a fairly mild disorder, it is still highly recommended that you consult a physician before attempting to treat it your self. There are many over the counter options for treating acne, most of which can be effective to at least some degree. It is tempting to just run down the corner store and purchase something based on the recommendation of a friend or a successful marketing campaign. You would be wiser thought to consult a Doctor, as they can advise you on the most effective type of treatment for your particular case of acne.There are a very large number of products available to treat acne at the current time. You can always take the advise of a friend that has used a particular product but you have to keep in mind that not all people react to medications the same and not all cases of acne are the same. There could be some significant differences between your acne and your friends. You will be better able to select the proper treatment for your situation if you have a basic knowledge of the active ingredients in the various acne medications. Benzoyl peroxide is one of the more popular active ingredients found in current acne treatments. It can be found in gels and creams and fights acne with a dual action. First it helps treat the bacteria on the surface of the skin that actually causes pimples. Secondly it helps to remove the dead skin cells and oils from the surface of your skin. When sebum combines with these dead skin cells it blocks the pores and causes black heads and white heads. Benzoyl peroxide has been determined to be safe in directly treating existing lesions. On clear skin it can be used as a preventative treatment, this will help keep the acne causing bacteria from developing on the skin. The only side effect is a tendency to cause dry skin which can be controlled by reducing the applications. Care should also be taken because it will bleach out hair and clothes. Salicylic acid is another common ingredient in acne treatments. It works by removing the dead skin cells that accumulate and block the skin pores. Salicylic acid products need to be used even when the skin is clear to keep the acne from re-occurring. The only reported side affect is drying and irritation of the skin in some people. The two other most common ingredients are sulfur and resorcinol. Resorcinol works by removing the entire top layer of skin which also effectively removes the dead skin cells before they can clog pores. Sulfur has been used to treat acne for over fifty years with significant success despite the fact that it is not known how it actually helps. Sulfur is frequently mixed with other treatments to help them be more effective but is not normally used on it's own because of the unpleasant odor. Benzoyl peroxide is probably the most versatile of the above ingredients. It can safely be used in creams, lotions, gels and soaps. These products should be used several times a day directly on the pimples as well as the skin around them.

","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" Macules and Scars Before I jump into the topic of scars, I need to clarify the difference between Macules and Scars. Macules may look like scars, but they are not scars in the sense that a permanent change has occurred. Macules are essentially the final stage of most inflamed acne lesions. They are normally flat, reddish spots that can remain for up to 8 months. But the difference between a Macule and a scar is that a Macule will end up disappearing completely whereas a scar will remain for years or indefinitely. As for scars, this can also vary from person to person. With some individuals, scars may remain for a lifetime without change but with others, their skin will undergo a form of remodeling that will eventually diminish the scar. Another factor that needs to be evaluated is the human element of scarring. People simply have different feelings about acne scars. Those who are distressed about their acne scars are much more likely to actively seek out treatment to moderate or remove the scar than those who are more indifferent about the scars. Cause of Scars Let us first gain a better understanding of acne scars by first determining the cause of scars. A scar is a mark left in the skin by the healing of a wound or surgical incision in which the normal functional tissue (skin) is replaced by connective tissue (scar). In the case of acne, the lesion is caused by the body’s inflammatory response to sebum, bacteria and dead cells that are trapped in the plugged sebaceous follicle. When your skin tissue has suffered a lesion of some sorts, your body will attempt to heal the injured site. It does so by increasing the white blood cells in the area along with an array of inflammatory molecules whose function is to repair the damaged tissue and fight infection. In the end, the repair job can be messy, and the site of the lesion is now filled with fibrous scar tissue or eroded tissue. As for the inflammatory molecules and white blood cells, they can remain at the acne lesion for days and even weeks. Take note of the fact that not everyone functions in the same way, and this holds true with our skin as well. Some people are simply more prone to scarring than others. Treatment for scars Bear in mind that treating acne and treating acne scars are two completely different things. Treating your acne has nothing to do with treating an acne scar. Acne scars can indeed be treated, but it is important that an acne sufferer bring their acne condition under control first if they still suffer from moderate to severe acne. Once your acne subsides, make an appointment with a dermatologist and discuss the methods (if applicable) of scar treatment(s) he/she recommend you undergo to treat your scars. Keep in mind that there are many methods with which you may treat your scars. These methods vary according to your scar type, size and location, type of skin, and of course, money $$$. All this should be discussed in great detail with your dermatologist. Before undergoing scar treatment, ask yourself the following questions before having your dermatologist undergo the decided procedure(s). Are you willing to wait and see if the scars will subside on their own with time? Do your acne scars affect you emotionally and socially? Is your scarring substantial enough to warrant scar treatment? Can you afford the treatment or what treatment options can you afford? Keep in mind, the objective of scar treatment is not to necessarily rid you of all indications of scars by completely restoring your skin. It very much depends on the severity of your scars, your skin type, your skins ability to regenerate, etc. Significant improvements can definitely be achieved, but complete restoration is often impossible.

Clinical studies are of evident that almost 100% of all teens have at least an occasional whitehead, blackhead or pimple. Several changes occur in your body and emotions while you step into adulthood because of hormone modifications. When hormones are highly active, the glands that are attached to hair follicles (sebaceous glands) produce more sebum—an oily substance that “lives” within the pores. An acne lesion (whitehead, blackhead or pimple) occurs when a hair follicle becomes plugged with the sebum and dead skin cells that are always being shed by the body. Brace yourself. When acne begins sometime between the ages of ten and thirteen, it is usually going to go on for five, or even ten, years! The most severe cases in some teens stem from the development of comedomes. Comedones are skin-coloured, small bumps that frequently show up on the forehead and chin of those with acne. Some may be so small that they are not visible to the naked eye – these are called microcomedones. The heaviest breakouts will be at their worst at about 3 to 5 years after the first comedones appear. The pimples and blackheads you’re experiencing right now should disappear sometime between ages of 20 and 25. However, the most severe cases -- nodular acne or cystic acne may not resolve until you’re 30 or over. Most of all, try not to isolate yourself just because you’re breaking out. Take a look around you. Lots of the kids you know are also walking around with acne – your parents probably suffered with it as well when they were adolescents. Ask them. Acne has not singled you out besides, you’re not alone in feeling the way you do. British teenagers conducted a survey and found that they are suffering the same emotional pain that you are. Almost 40% of them have avoided going to school because they were embarrassed. Over half of them felt that acne prevented them from having a boyfriend or girlfriend. About one-third said it got in the way of them being able to make friends. By treating your acne properly, you can protect yourself from the emotional effects of your condition, and you can stop the breakouts from getting worse.

As if it wasn’t difficult enough, puberty can leave some scarred years after they thought they were done with all those annoying self-produced blemishes. The good news is that now, through medical and technological advancements, these long-suffering people can once again have beautiful and smooth skin. In 2001, an index of the different types of acne scars that affected people was released. This made significant forward steps in the identification of acne scarring and therefore in the treatment of those particular scars. This breaks down into three major categories or types of scarring; Rolling scars occur when the subcutaneous tissue that lies just below the surface of the skin becomes attached to one another. Treatment for this type of scarring requires the breaking up of the attached subcutaneous fibrous bands. Boxcar scars are oval or round shaped with sharp vertical edges. These can be shallow scars or run very deep. The deeper boxcar scars will more often require a treatment known as full-thickness. The shallower boxcar scars can be treated with less invasive skin resurfacing procedures. Ice pick scars are narrow, acute scars that can run deep and make the skin seem like it has been repeatedly punctured, as with an ice pick. Laser resurfacing and dermabrasion are usually the preferred methods of dealing with this type of scarring. For milder cases, there are now a wide variety of topical creams and lotions that can be quite effective in covering and repairing shallower acne scarring. The important thing to do is to get the correct type of solution for your particular type of skin. A physician or dermatologist can be very helpful in determining what kind is the appropriate one. There are several treatment methods that have become available over the past few years. Consulting a dermatologist or similar specialist will help determine which would be the best option. Dermal fillers are injections in the skin that cause the surface of the scars to rise which gives it an even look as opposed to a rough pitted appearance. Subcutaneous Incisions are what is used in the treatment of the rolling scars. A surgical needle is inserted under the skin and used to break up the attached subcutaneous fiber bands. This surgery is a little more invasive and can cause bruising in the affected area that goes away in about a week. The last, laser resurfacing, is a treatment that is used for a variety of skin problems in addition to acne scarring. Basically, a laser is used to burn the surface layer of the affected area. Depth of the laser is in accordance with the depth of the scarring. As the treated area heals, the burned layer of skin is replaced with a fresh, healed layer. If you are considering one of these treatments, it is important to do some research about which is the right and most efficient one. Of course, because people who are highly specialized do these treatments, any of these procedures can end up costing a good deal of money.  You must decide which is the best for you and which one is the most conducive to your budget. Remember that there are lots of options out there, so don’t be afraid to do some research and find out what works best for you. "},{"title":" Mild and moderate acne isn’t the end of the world!

Many times it takes trial and error to find the product that will work for you…and you need to give each product about two weeks to reach any kind of effectiveness. A new wave in treating acne is the product Proactiv. After countless infomercials, ads in magazines and on the internet, it is becoming one of the most widely known acne treatments on the market. With celebrities raving about the results they get with this product, many people are trying it out…with mixed results. The ingredients in Proactiv can be found in many of the other treatments you can get at local stores. The difference between the products - the price. One specific type of acne that many people find frequently on their face are blackheads, a particularly difficult type of acne to get rid of. Found mostly on the nose, cheeks and ears, this type of acne is a very deep, hard to reach blemish that can feel like it is impossible to treat. However, products are on the market to help with this type of acne as well. Commonly known as “nose strips”, this treatment consists of a strip that has a substance on it that dries and literally removes the blackhead from the pore. Washing does little to stop blackheads from appearing on your face, but washing should be done if you try to squeeze this type of acne. You can do more damage to your face trying to “self-extract” blackheads! Today there is a relatively new treatment out there for mild to moderate acne. It is a hand-held device known as the Zeno Acne Clearing Device. This FDA approved acne clearing device applies a precise 2 ½ minute heat treatment to acne. This heat treatment essentially kills the bacteria causing the acne, thus healing the pimple. Unlike other treatments on the market, the Zeno Acne Clearing Device can actually clear up a pimple in a day as opposed to days or even weeks with other alternatives. Although the heat from the zeno device can cause mild redness to the area where applied for roughly 20-30 minutes after you use it, no other adverse side effects were reported by users…unlike the skin irritation that topical treatments can cause. Good hygiene is still the best way to fight acne on your face and other parts of your body. Washing your face regularly with a mild soap will usually keep acne at bay. Regular soap and water won’t irritate your face like some acne treatment products may. Only those with severe acne will require any kind of visits to a dermatologist for prescription acne medications.

My facts and conclusions 1.Hormones are chemical substances ,which regulate ALL functions in human body (they tell organs and cells what to do) 2.In human body exist various hormones,but for acne,we are interested in testosterone (androgen) 3. The most active androgens are testosterone, precisely 5-testosterone (DHT) and they control SEBUM production. Too much of Sebum leads to acne formation. Why we have no acne before puberty? Simply because testosterone formation begins in puberty. 4.Other hormones can also aggravate acne, but they are not direct cause.ExampleStress situations,when our body produce hormone called glucocorticosteroids. 5.DIRECT cause of Acne is not food,stress, poor hygiene,vitamins and bacteries on our skin. Bacteries are just last player in our story.Even hormones are not direct cause. Direct cause of Acne is HORMONAL IMBALANCE on the first place, and toxins in our body on the second place. This is my list of main acne causes Complex Mix of causes of Prostaglandin insufficiency > insufficiency of Prostaglandins > Hormonal imbalance > Liver can not remove all those hormones and send it to the skin > Acne As you can see,liver health is very important. What the hell is prostaglandin,you ask? The messengers, or communicators between the cells and the hormones are called Prostaglandins and without them there will be no communication between the cells and your hormones. When there is no communication, hormones will be out of balance. Prostaglandins are biochemicals that communicate with hormones and cells and trigger cells into action. Prostaglandins work inside the cells and help regulate the function of cells and organs through the communication of cells and hormones. Prostaglandins make sure your androgen hormones are in balance, as they regulate your hormones so that just the right amount of sebum will be produced by your skin oil glands and thus prevent excess amounts of sebum production that leads to acne. 6. Why there is no sufficient number of prostaglandins in our bodies? Because we have no enough of GLA- gamma-linnolenic acid , which is main precursor of prostaglandins. GLA is a special fatty acid from which the body can produce Prostaglandins. GLA is made from LA-Linolenic Acid, which we take through the various food. Main problem is inability of our body to convert LA to GLA ,because of stress.bad habits,foods,alcohol,lack of vitamins etc. (if we have no enough GLA ,our body can not produce prostaglandins,which regulate hormones). 7. What’s happening when we are out of prostaglandins? Hormonal imbalance! If there is an over-load of hormones in your body, the liver can have problems removing them.Liver sends overbalanced hormones our skin in form of ACNE! So,Strong Liver is a must for all acne sufferers! 8. So,what is the final solution for Acne? Answer is Restoration of Hormonal balance and making your liver stronger. This can not be done with topical and oral drugs. It can be done with HERBS and their extracts in form of tablets. GLA is main ingredient of Omega 6 fatty acid. It is best absorbed together with other fatty acids EPA and DHA. Source Naturals ArcticPure EFA Fish Oil Contains  Essential fatty acids EPA, DHA, and GLA Evening primrose oil is an oil rich in essential fatty acids , polyunsaturated fats that are as essential as vitamins and minerals for the maintenance of good health. The oil contains 74 percent linolenic acid (LA) and 8-10 percent gamma linolenic acid (GLA). Although other oils such as borage oil and black currant oil contain higher amounts of GLA, evening primrose oil is by far the most popular and familiar source of this fatty acid. Some herbs make your liver stronger. Milk Thistle is best known. more on this topic on my blog http//acne-guidelines.blogspot.com "},{"title":" Natural Acne Remedies ","word_count":347,"summary":" Some adults and teens who suffer from acne may refer to try cures that are natural instead of pharmaceutical.

Along with a glowing and radiant complexion you might shed a few pounds along the way! To go along with a healthier diet supplements are suggested. Here are some supplement suggestions. A good daily multi vitamin. Vitamin C. An antioxidant blend of A, C, E, zinc, selenium. A fatty acid supplement such as primrose oil or fish oil. It is suggested that you talk with a qualified nutritionist to help with deciding what supplements you should take. Now you've taken care of the inside, there is work to do on the outside. Have a facial monthly. This will help keep your skin healthy and glowing. Your aesthetician will help you to identify your skin type and make recommendations about cleansers and moisturizers. This facial should include an exfoliation. If you suffer from acne as an adult you will still need to keep your skin moisturized. Make sure that you use an SPF on your skin everyday. There is no such thing as an overnight cure for acne. Keep in mind that any treatment takes time. A healthy diet, added nutritional supplements and a well thought out cleaning regimen will help. Give any program you start on at least 6 to 8 weeks to show results.

Or, even worse, these chemical products may have done damage to their skin far worse then the acne. Chemical products often come with side effects that natural acne treatments do not. For this reason and many others, selecting a natural cure for acne seems to be the logical way to go. What Is Natural? A natural cure for acne will be one that has products in it that are not man made but naturally occurring in the world. These products can be virtually anything as long as they are non toxic to the body. Many natural acne skin care products are the best for your body as the body already knows how to work with these natural substances and therefore can be better suited for you. What’s Available Then? There are several natural products available to help individuals to remove acne. These products range in what they are and how they are used so it is important for you to know how to use them properly. Most of the acne skin care treatments available will include a number of different vitamins, proteins and natural acids. Some may contain zinc as it is well known for being effective in the treatment of acne. Some will include Chromium as this too has been shown to help. In most cases, there will be a combination of products that work together at treating the acne. Why Is It There? One thing that is important to consider when treating acne is why it is there in the first place. When you find this out, you are better able to find an acne treatment that will work for your specific condition. There are two main causes of acne that have a lot to do with each other. First off, acne skin care treatments may attack the bacteria that are on the face causing the infection which is the acne itself. But, these bacteria will likely be attracted to the skin because of the high amount of oils there. Some individuals have glands that are working overtime to produce and this provides bacteria the ultimate place to live. Most acne skin care products need to work on both aspects of turning off the oil and getting rid of the acne. The best natural acne treatment is the one that is well suited to your specific situation. Yet, it is ideal for you to use natural products as they are the best suited, in most cases, to provide you with a fighting chance against acne.

However, it is very important to consider the risk of scarring when choosing a certain treatment. Natural acne treatments are both efficient and cost effective and they reduce the risk of scarring. These treatments include a balanced diet, vitamins and nutritional supplements, herbs and bodywork. Diet A died based mostly on whole and unprocessed food is often beneficial for people who suffer from acne. Try to eat vegetables at least five times a day and fruits at least once. Refined sugar should be avoid it. You should also avoid fried foods, trans fats, such as milk or margarine and hydrogenated vegetable oils. It is recommended to consume foods that contain omega-3 oils, such as sardines or flax seeds. There are also some opinions claiming that chocolate, coffee, salt, shellfish, wheat products and carbonated drinks increase acne. It is also important to drink a lot of water. You should try to have at list 8 glasses of water each day. Fiber intake is also recommended. In addition to fruits and vegetables, you should also eat whole grain. Some people claim that a liver detox diet from one to four weeks based on fruits and vegetables helps with acne. Vitamins & Nutritional Supplements Vitamin A can help with reducing sebum production. However, you should be careful not to exaggerate, as high doses of vitamin A can lead to a decreased bone density, headache, muscle and joint pain and birth defects. Sexually active women of childbearing age shouldn't take more than 5,000 IU per day unless they are guided by a professional and are using at least two birth control methods. It's not necessary to take vitamin A if there's an adequate intake of vitamin E, zinc and beta-carotene, which contribute to vitamin A formation. Zinc gluconate or zinc sulfate are also effective natural acne treatments. Two studies comparing zinc to antibiotic tetracycline have found that zinc is as effective as tetracycline. Zinc helps with healing blemishes, reducing inflammation as well as reducing androgenic hormonal effects on skin. This is why you should increase the intake of foods that contain zinc gluconate or zinc sulfate, such as seafoods, red meat or poultry. Vitamin B6 helps with pre-menstrual or mid-cycle acne and is essential for the metabolism of steroid hormones. It can also reduce skin sensitivity to testosterone effects. Herbs An effective natural acne treatment is obtained by mixing equal parts of sarsaparilla, burdock, yellow dock and cleavers extracts. It is believed that these herbs are blood and lymph cleansers. Half a teaspoon of this mixture should be taken three times a day. The treatment has best effects if combined with a healthy diet. Tea tree oil also helps with reducing acne. If applied to erupted blemishes, it helps eliminating the bacteria and reducing inflammation. Bodywork Massage is another natural treatment recommended for people with acne problems. Bodywork helps increasing blood circulation and lymphatic drainage, thus fastening the blemish healing process. Stress Reduction Generally, stress is an important factor in many health problems, including acne. Reducing stress can be seen as a natural acne treatment. Some of the most common ways to reduce stress include yoga, physical exercise, meditation and breathing techniques. Doing things that you enjoy and avoiding stress factors is also very helpful.

Acne is caused by some imbalances in our body and internal impurities. This is the main reason to the imperative knowledge that the way to really get rid of acne is through internal cleansing. Using topical medications and oral antibiotics as acne treatment does not guarantee the disappearance of these menacing and painful spots that invade the face. What artificial medications do is only target one or just a few of the causes of acne and a few more of the symptoms. This requires acne sufferers to use different products to treat just the individual cause and symptom of this skin disorder. Oftentimes, they could even worsen the disorder because of their side effects. Herbal alternative, holistic remedy, nature's way. Whatever you call it, natural treatment is one of the most resorted forms of therapeutic means for many debilitating diseases. One of them is dealing with acne. The ultimate realization is that acne should be dealt with by performing internal cleansing treatments that target the source right away and fights acne before it even has the chance to begin. And there's no other way to do this but to seek help from natural acne treatment sources. Natural acne treatment is good for dealing with moderate to severe cases of acne. The advantage of natural acne treatment is that it does not only attacks the symptoms. This natural method treats the cause of acne. Natural acne treatments usually entail modifying the eating habit to relieve the symptoms. It is about cleansing the vital organs. In this kind of cure, herbs are used to provide nutrients and sustenance to the vital organs and also aids in cleansing internally. Some of the herbs or herbal concoctions and topical preparations reported to do well as natural acne treatment are the following Olive leaf extract - potent for strengthening the liver Herbal cortisone - mimics the effectiveness of cortisone as an effective acne treatment without the side effects Jing Huang Gao - a Chinese herbal cream Tea Tree Oil - said to be the same effect with that of five percent benzoyl peroxide How does natural acne treatment work? Herbal remedies for acne actually target the liver. Why? It is because liver is the organ that cleans up the troubles of our hormones - one of kinds of chemicals produced by the body to ensure proper function. And when our hormones get messed up, the skin makes it obvious by giving birth to these annoying critters in the form of acne. Herbs contain vitamins, minerals and plant nutrients that provide the body nourishment and some unexplained energy source. These herbal alternatives are reported to be fine when taken for long-term but should only be taken seasonally. Another way that natural acne treatment through herbs is carried out is the ability of some herbs to kill fungi that weaken the liver. A healthy liver functions well to cleanse our blood of the dirt from excess hormones. And with our blood clean, consequently, our skin's condition will improve. That's the herbs' ways of accomplishing the natural acne treatment process. "},{"title":" Natural Acne Treatments Work Well -But Not for Everyone! ","word_count":651,"summary":" Some natural acne treatments work better than others. And some not at all. Each case is different, but it just might be worthwhile to try the natural way first. ","keywords":" Acne Treatment, Natural, Pimples, zit, Clear Skin, dermatologist ","article_body":" Copyright 2006 Tony Buel I have come across many interesting suggestions during the search for a natural acne treatment that really works. Some of the ideas are really viable options that can be easily carried out while others do not make much sense at all. Many believe that a person's complexion depends on his diet and this is probably true to some extent. One of the suggestions for a natural acne treatment was to skip breakfast. This comes as a big surprise because it goes against everything we are taught about breakfast and good nutrition. We all know that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. We are constantly reminded of that. Many researchers suggest that breakfast actually helps us burn calories throughout the day. Skipping breakfast as a natural acne treatment seems a little radical, but there is a lucid argument for using this technique for keeping clear skin. Breakfast is not really the problem. The problem is the individual's diet in general. Your body needs to cleanse itself of what you ate the previous day. Of course, many of us know that the term breakfast comes from break the fast. We fast every night during our sleep. The act of fasting is a natural acne treatment because it cleanses the body of toxins that may wind up on our faces. The radical anti-breakfast group suggests that we shouldn't break the fast first thing in the morning. Drinking a glass of water for breakfast is a natural acne treatment that helps the body flush out the bad stuff that we wind up wearing on our faces as pimples. Supporters of this natural acne treatment suggest that no food should be ingested until noon. The only thing you should ingest is water. This approach seems a little too extreme for me, but it may be something that someone with severe acne would want to consider. I have skipped many breakfasts over the years to drop a pound or two. If you don't get up until eleven in the morning, the fast won't seem as bad. Unfortunately, many of us have to get up in the morning and those hours can be very hard on an empty stomach. The endorsers of this natural acne treatment swear that you will notice results in a few days. That is if you don't faint. I guess that it all boils down to how important it really is to you. Using fasting as a natural acne treatment may seem like a small price to pay for someone who has a severe acne problem. Many individuals are so focused on dealing with their current pimples that they forget the most important step, which is prevention. In this day and age, there is no reason why any and all of us can't properly battle acne breakouts. With the World-Wide-Web at our fingertips, there are always a plethora of acne tips to aid us. What are you cleansing your mug with? This is an important factor in staying oil and dirt free, hence preventing new breakouts. You need a gentle cleanser such as Purpose that will wash away the bad stuff, but not strip your skin dry in the process. The last thing you need is dry skin. This can actually stir more breakouts. Other acne tips to live by are always shower with tepid water in order to avoid over-drying, always change your pillowcase each night before bed, only use a moisturizer on areas that are dry, and use a topical medication on your skin after cleansing if your acne dilemma calls for it. We all have different bouts with blemishes. And remember, not all acne is the same.  Always keep open the option that you will consult with a dermatologist about your specific case.  Some cases are more stubborn than others and a dermatologist may be the answer to resolving your particular symptoms quickly and effectively.

The condition generally begins in the teenage years, but can affect people into their thirties and forties. Blemishes often cause people to avoid social situations and, in extreme cases, can lead to feelings of depression. The exact cause of acne is not known, but there are several theories. One is that break outs tend to be hereditary. If parents and siblings suffer from it, you may too. Another is that the hormones that surge through the body in puberty cause the sebaceous glands to increase in size and produce more oils. This leads to an increase in blemishes. Other hormonal causes include pregnancy, menstruation and birth control pills. Although the exact cause of this skin condition is unknown, there are factors that can aggravate it. Squeezing a blemish can spread bacteria and cause more break outs on your face. Excessive humidity and sweating can also spread bacteria and aggravate the condition. There are several myths surrounding acne. Stress is thought to cause acne, but it does not. However, the stress you feel as a result of the pimples is real. Consider relaxation techniques, reading the bible and prayer as a way to reduce this stress. Other myths include diet and having dirty skin. Proper skin care can help prevent the spread of acne. Improper skin care can actually make blemishes worse. Excessive scrubbing with harsh cleansers is drying, causes irritations and can create more pimples. Use a gentle cleanser no more than twice a day, if your skin is excessively oily, you can wash three times. Look for a gentle cleanser that is made for your skin type. Salicylic acid is a good ingredient to look for. Don’t use astringent unless you have very oily skin. Astringents can dry out the skin and make it worse. You may be tempted to skip the moisturizer, but don’t do this. Your skin needs moisture. Choose a product that is made for people who are prone to pimples. Look for an oil free, non acnegenic lotion. Dermatologists can help with acne treatment. Topical ointments and oral medications can be prescribed for extreme cases. Many of these prescriptions can cause photosensitivity. You should always wear a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, if you go in the sun while using prescription medications. For maximum rejuvenation, your doctor may recommend a chemical peel. In the past, you could only have a peel in the dermatologist’s office. Now there is a home treatment alternative. Esthetician’s Choice is a medical grade peel that you can use in the comfort of your home. The main ingredient is Trichloroacetic Acid (TCA) which is considered to be the most effective skin peel product on the market. TCA is a non toxic chemical that has been used by dermatologists for over 30 years to treat acne and other skin conditions. Peels exfoliate the skin on a deeper level than can be achieved with most other skin care products. Easy to follow, step by step directions allow you to perform the peel easily at home. Esthetician’s Choice takes only minutes to apply. You may experience a slight reddening for a day or tow and the skin will continue to peel, revealing clearer skin underneath. You will notice results quickly, unlike topical ointments and medications, which can take months to see results. Use the peel full strength for a deeper peel, or you can dilute it for surface exfoliation.

Most people, when first faced with an acne condition, usually go to the local pharmacy and buy an over-the-counter medication on the basis of recommendations from their friends or perhaps even television ads. It's always a good idea, however, to consult with a doctor before using any kind of over-the-counter medication. Even though acne is a fairly benign condition, a doctor can advise on the best course of treatment and also offers suggestions based on your particular kind of acne. Because of the large number of products available for treating acne, it can be difficult to decide which one to try. Depending on advice from your friends is not too reliable, because what works for one person may not work for another. It's best if you have some background knowledge about the active ingredients in various acne medications, so you can make a better informed choice about which medication to try. One of the most popular ingredients in acne treatments is benzoyl peroxide. It is found in gels and ointments and works by combating the bacteria which causes pimples. It is also useful for removing dead skin cells that accumulate on the surface of the skin. It is these dead skin cells which combine with sebum to create blackheads and whiteheads. Benzoyl peroxide has been proven to be safe and effective in combating lesions. It can be used after acne has cleared up to keep the skin free from acne causing bacteria. The only side effect associated with this ingredient is dry skin, and this can be avoided by decreasing the frequency that it is applied on the skin. It can also bleach hair and clothing, so care must be taken when applying it. Another popular ingredient in acne medications is salicylic acid. This prevents acne by clearing up dead skin cells which are accumulating too quickly and clogging the pores. Products which contain salicylic acid should continue to be used after the skin has cleared up to prevent future outbreaks of acne. The only side effects associated with salicylic acid are dry, irritated skin. Other ingredients you may see in acne medications include resorcinol and sulphur. Resorcinol causes the top layer of skin to peel -- including the dead skin cells which clog the pores. It is often combined with sulphur. It is not known how sulphur affects acne conditions, but it has been used effectively for more than 50 years. Sulphur is often combined with other ingredients besides resorcinol like salicylate acid and benzoyl peroxide. It is not usually used by itself because of its strong, unpleasant odor. Of all these ingredients used for combating acne, benzoyl peroxide is probably the most versatile. It can be used in cleansing liquids or bars, as well as lotion, cream, and gels which are applied directly on the skin. The cleansing products are usually used once or twice a day, while the creams and lotions can be used as needed. They should be applied on the skin around the acne as well as the pimples themselves for most effectiveness. You must avoid getting benzoyl peroxide in the eyes, mouth or nose as it will cause irritation or inflammation.

","keywords":" acne, acne medication ","article_body":" In the early stage of the ongoing war with acne, most people go to a pharmacy to buy an over-the-counter medication. There are so many treatments available for acne, that it can be a complicated decision. Advice from friends is not a reliable method for making a choice, because what worked for 1 person may not work for another. And advertising advice? Who trusts that? You can make a more informed choice about which product to try just by knowing about the active ingredients in the various acne medications. Benzoyl Peroxide 1 of the most popular ingredients in acne medications, benzoyl peroxide is available in gels and ointments. It kills the bacteria that causes pimples and helps remove dead skin cells that build up on the surface of the skin. These dead skin cells, when combined with sebum (oil), create blackheads and whiteheads. Dry skin is the only side effect, which can be minimized with less frequent application. It has a bleaching effect, so avoid hair and clothing when applying it. Salicylic Acid This is a popular acne ingredient which clears up dead skin cells that clog the pores. Continued use  even after the skin has cleared up is necessary to avoid future acne outbreaks. Again, the side effect is dry, irritated skin. Resorcinol Resorcinol causes the top layer of skin to peel, which removes the dead skin cells that clog pores. It is often combined with sulphur. Sulphur Because of a strong, unpleasant odor, sulphur is usually combined with other ingredients. How it works is unknown, but it's been used effectively for decades. Sulphur is often combined with salicylate acid and benzoyl peroxide. Products Of all these ingredients, benzoyl peroxide is probably the most versatile. It can be made into cleansing liquids, bars, gels, lotions and cream, all of which are applied directly to the skin. Cleansing products are usually used once or twice daily, with creams and lotions applied as needed. They are most effective when rubbed on the area surrounding the acne, as well as on the pimples themselves. It's always a good idea to discuss acne with a doctor before self-treating with any of these medications. Even though acne is a fairly harmless condition, a doctor can often offer better suggestions and explain the best way to handle your condition based on your particular kind of acne.

The body physically changes as the fat tissue increases in the hips, thighs, and breasts producing the typical hourglass shape of females. With all these changes going on, what effect does acne have on girls during puberty? During puberty girls experience an increased likelihood and severity of acne from the increased oil secretions in the skin. Puberty is often a difficult time and acne only adds to the difficulty. During puberty girls usually experience increased irritability, mood swings, and feelings of low self esteem. Even girls who have been very sure of themselves may suffer from low self esteem when puberty sets in. These changes may be even more severe in the girl also suffers from acne. The negative changes in girls during puberty are made even worse if acne is a problem. You can help deal with the changes when you know how to lessen the problems of acne. Practical Acne Treatments For Girls... Proper skin care is the first step in treating acne. The face should be gently washed with a facial cleanser. There are many skin care products on the market that may help with acne. To kill the bacteria that cause acne the cleanser should contain salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide or sulfur. Gentle cleansing is an important factor when dealing with acne. A common mistake is to clean the face too often and with harsh cleansers. Careful cleaning of the face twice a day is the best way to go. There are some cosmetics that can be detrimental if you are trying to control acne so it is important to use non-comedogenic products. Non-comedogenic products are less likely to cause acne, blackheads or block the pores of the skin. Today there are many non-comedogenic products available, such as makeup, lip stick, moisturizers, and even acne medicated makeup. The changes experienced during puberty can take a mental and physical toll on girls. The onset of acne certainly makes these changes even harder to deal with. It is a good idea to visit with a dermatologist if the acne can not be controlled with over-the-counter medications. A dermatologist will understand the changes that are associated with acne and will be able to offer advice and treatment programs. It's also important to be understanding and offer support to girls as they go through the difficult time of puberty.

It can be physically and emotionally painful and embarrassing. It can cause feelings of isolation, low-self esteem, even depression. Acne affects nearly everyone at some point in his or her life, whether it's during puberty, pregnancy (or during some other hormonally-charged period in life), or just during any time of adulthood. But there are ways to prevent and even control acne if you take a preemptive approach. The best way to counteract the effects of this skin problem is to carry out a proactive acne treatment, which will help you to take care of your body as well as your skin. Proactive is defined as acting in advance of an expected problem, or to be anticipatory. If you know that you are prone to acne, anticipating the problem and taking steps to defend yourself against it is the best way to go. There are several proactive acne treatment measures that a person can take in order to reduce the amount of breakouts, and to keep the breakouts that do occur from being too bad. One of the best ways to deal with acne is through exercise. Exercise is not only a great way to regulate your weight and keep your body in good physical condition, but it also helps to lower stress levels that can cause or aggravate acne. In addition, sweating is a way of cleaning out the body, ridding it of oils and bad bacteria. It is important, though, to wear lightweight, breathable fabrics when exercising. Perspiration that is trapped between fabric and the skin can let bacteria grow and clog the pores, which will lead to acne. Another effective proactive acne treatment is through diet. Though it is commonly understood now that what you eat does not cause acne, it is also commonly known that certain vitamins and minerals help the body fight the war on acne. It is a good idea to eat a healthy, well-balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals such as vitamins A, B, C, and E. This will not only give you a healthy body, but will help to curb breakouts. In addition, drinking plenty of water will help keep your skin looking fresh, and your color bright. Stress has an immense effect on a person's complexion. We wear our problems on our faces, in the form of dark circles, wrinkles, and yes, even acne. There are a variety of stressors that affect us in different ways. Stressors are things that cause anxiety to your body and your well-being, which can also cause or aggravate an acne problem. Certain external stressors involve things that negatively affect the outside of your body, and include such things as oil-ridden cosmetics, overexposure to the sun, and a poor diet. Internal stressors include factors that cause anxiety, depression, or low self esteem. Not dealing with emotions or high stress levels can cause acne flare-ups or other outward indications of inward problems. As mentioned before, exercise is an ideal way to manage stress. Also, participating in activities that you enjoy can also reduce your stress levels. And, don't forget to get an abundance of sleep if at all possible. Sleep provides your mind and body time to rest and rejuvenate. There are several acne treatments that you can perform that, if done on a regular basis, prove to be highly effective, proactive measures. For example, always try to use oil-free cosmetics that won't clog your pores. Shaving the skin with a light touch and a sharp razor or even an electric shaver helps to exfoliate the skin and won't be too rough on skin that is broken out. It is best, though to avoid areas of the skin that are especially irritated or infected, and allow them time to heal. Also, make sure to gently wash your face twice daily with lightly exfoliating products. Do not ever scrub the skin, for this can lead to further irritation and more acne problems. Taking the proactive approach to acne treatment is by far the best way to avoid embarrassing or painful breakouts. And you will find in doing so, that you will not only have healthier looking skin, but that your body and general well-being will be healthier in the effort as well. "},{"title":" Pregnancy and Acne Treatment ","word_count":684,"summary":" If you are a pregnant woman, you should be cautious about what acne treatment products you use. Some over-the-counter products may contain ingredients that can harm your unborn child and cause birth defects. ","keywords":" acne, acne solutions, skin care, acne treatment, beauty tips, Proactive, Proactive solution, Proactiv ","article_body":" Do you ever see all those Clearasil or Oxy 10 commercials with the completely blemish free teenagers smiling broadly and telling you about how their perfect complexions were a result of the use of that product? It doesn’t seem like these over-the-counter and massively available acne solutions could be of any threat to anybody, but if you’re a pregnant woman, you should be aware of a few things. There are many acne treatments that are available and safe to use during pregnancy, many of them natural and available right in the home. On the other hand, many manufactured products should be avoided during pregnancy. It should be noted first that some acne during pregnancy is fairly common among women. During the first trimester, as the body prepares itself to provide for two, hormone levels increase and cause a rise in the body’s oil production. The result is acne flare-ups. The good news is that this usually clears up by the second trimester as the body begins to plateau in hormone levels. The two most common ingredients found in the majority of most acne treatments are Benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. It has been tested and determined that benzoyl peroxide is safe for women to use during pregnancy. However, it has also been determined that salicylic acid that is taken orally, such as a pill, has been known to cause some birth defects and may complicate pregnancy. Women must be careful when selecting a product to use, as a product that contains benzoyl peroxide will often contain salicylic acid as well. So what about a topical application of salicylic acid? It has not been proven that it will cause birth defects or pregnancy complications, but as a pregnant woman that knows now that salicylic acid taken orally is potentially harmful, do you really want to run that risk? Some acne treatment products that doctors have recommended pregnant women should avoid are retinoid, oral retinoid, and Accutane. Retinoid is a form of Vitamin A that can cause birth defects in unborn children. There is no evidence that retinoid taken topically is harmful, but again, why run that risk? For the desperate new mother that is trying to treat her skin, there are a variety of safe and natural ways to fight off acne. Of course, before women begin any new treatment they should consult their physician or obstetrician. Some products that mothers can safely use topically are Echinacea, lavender essential oil, and tea tree oil. But there are also even easier things one can do to control their outbreaks. Keeping your skin clean by washing with soap and rinsing with warm water to rinse off any remaining soap that may stay and cause block-ups or break-outs is one of the easiest things to do for extra care. After your face is washed and rinsed, avoid picking or popping blemishes to prevent scarring. It should also be mentioned that diet plays an important part in controlling acne. A high fruit and vegetable ratio in a woman’s diet should be maintained throughout pregnancy to not only help keep acne more clear, but also for the baby’s proper growth and development. Apples and blueberries are both rich in antioxidants, making them very good fruits to consume for the prevention of future outbreaks. There are also a number of “household” treatments available. A mask of warm oatmeal cooked without additional ingredients in it and applied to the face for about 15-20 minutes may begin to clear up blemishes in as little as a few days. A lemon that has been cut in half and put on acne is another possibility. Uncooked natural oatmeal, garlic, olive oil, mashed potatoes, and even warm sugar water are ways to fight blemishes and prevent new ones from forming again. So mothers, if you find yourself going through those frustrating outbreaks during your pregnancy period, have a little patience, try to go natural, eat a healthy diet of low-fat and preservative-free foods, and stay away from all those manufactured products that claim to clear your face up in five days or less.

","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" From sweet 16 to fabulous 40 and beyond, acne is a condition that affects almost everyone at some time in their lives. According to the National Institutes of Health, nearly 85 percent of adolescents and young adults between the ages of 12 and 24 develop the condition, and some people continue to be affected into their forties and fifties. “It’s important to remember that acne has both internal and external causes,” says Amy Baker, founder of Nature’s Cure, an innovative health and beauty products company. “However, there are some basic precautions you can take to help prevent breakouts.” Here are some tips from Baker for people of any age who want to keep their skin clear * Don’t pick, pop or squeeze, or otherwise mess with your skin. Squeezing blemishes or whiteheads can lead to infection or scarring. It almost always makes the acne you have worse. * Wash your pillowcase often and always use clean face towels. Dirty towels and pillowcases can harbor bacteria and germs that can make acne worse. * Be sure to pull your hair away from your skin when you sleep. * Try to shower as soon as possible after your workout since sweat combined with skin oils can trap dirt and bacteria in your pores. * Don’t go to bed with makeup on. It can clog your pores and lead to breakouts. * Make sure to clean cosmetic brushes regularly in soapy water and throw out old, contaminated makeup. * Use topical treatments, such as Nature's Cure Vanishing Cream, anywhere that you tend to get breakouts -- don't just spot-treat existing pimples. The pore-clogging process happens two to three weeks before any blemish becomes visible on the skin. For a more complete treatment option, there is an innovative over-the-counter remedy called Nature’s Cure. “Because acne is caused by a combination of factors, including internal triggers that can cause imbalances inside the body, and an overproduction of oil and trapped bacteria on the outside, the most effective way to treat it is by addressing both areas,” explains Baker. “The treatment includes all natural tablets to rebalance the body, and a cream that works to clear up existing pimples at the same time,” she adds. * Exercising regularly can help reduce stress and it increases blood circulation and oxygen penetration to the skin, which may help to prevent acne. * Drink at least 64 ounces of water a day to help \"detoxify\" the body from the inside out. By taking these simple precautions, most people can reduce the occurrence of acne. There are also a variety of products available to help in healing or preventing breakouts. However, consumers should be careful about what they choose to use. “Most acne prevention products either don’t work very well or have a litany of side effects,” says Baker. “Unlike other options, Nature’s Cure is a homeopathic treatment that is made from minerals, herbs and other natural extracts that activate the body’s natural defenses. Because these ingredients are in minute concentrations, they trigger the body to heal itself without side effects.” The formula is available in a male and female version. “Male and female bodies and hormonal compositions are different, and you have to address those differences when you are treating acne,” says Baker. Nature’s Cure also offers a two-part body acne treatment that includes tablets and a medicated body spray that can be sprayed from any angle to treat hard-to-reach places like the back and neck.

The proactive acne treatment is a combination therapy that studies all aspects of the acne problem in order to search out a viable solution. The first step of proactive treatment in acne relies on the premise that the skin blemish is healed before further steps to check its reappearance are taken in hand. The start point of skin healing in the proactive approach is to examine the ways in which the skin can be cleaned, with the help of an effective skin cleanser. The ideal cleanser to effect a healing of skin blemished by acne is one that will help exfoliate the skin and expose the dead skin cells. The exfoliated skin can then be treated with benzoyl peroxide as that will kill the bacteria causing acne to appear on the skin surface. The benzoyl will also be in a position to penetrate the skin pores as the cleanser has exfoliated the skin sufficiently. This action will not only heal the blemishes but also attack the bacteria, providing a curing and preventive action in one go. With the immediate problem taken in hand the next stage of the three-way proactive approach to control acne is to choose an ideal skin toner. When shopping for the right product one should look for a skin toner that is alcohol free and is a water based toner. This kind of skin toner will help remove dead skin cells and unplug clogged pores, allowing the skin to remain healthy and acne free. It will also help in the removal of excess oil that usually forms on skins prone to acne eruptions. The application of such a skin tone on a regular basis will thus help balance the skin tone and maintain a skin that is acne free and free of oil imbalance and clogged pores. In the final stages, when the healing effect is well on the course and the skin is limping back to its original health, steps have to be taken to assist the process and recover lost ground. In such state a repairing lotion must be applied regularly on the skin. The skin at this stage is acne free but the scars of blackheads and whiteheads are just skin deep. So the users are advised to apply oil-free repairing lotion that will heal blackheads and whiteheads, while making the skin glow and acne blemishes, a thing of the past.

","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" It usually strikes in plainly visible locations such as the face, neck, chest and back. Acne can be caused by a number of factors such as contact with an oily substance, use of certain medication, steroids, or the secretion of certain hormones. Over ninety percent of acne patients respond to treatment, although the treatment may need to be continued for months or even years. Here are a few natural remedies that you can use to cure acne. What Causes Acne? As mentioned above, acne can be caused by a number of factors. Common causes of acne include contact with an oily substance such as mineral oil, vegetable oil, or petroleum and the use of certain medication such as steroids or the contraceptive pill. However, acne is most often caused by the secretion of androgens, or sex hormones that are initially secreted at the onset of puberty. Androgens are male hormones but they are secreted by females as well. They stimulate the production of oil from the skin's oil glands. When these oil glands become overactive and the exit from the gland is blocked, oil builds up in the gland and they begin to swell. This is how acne forms. A bacteria called Propionibacterium acnes normally colonizes this swollen gland causing the development of inflammation and pus. In particularly severe cases, the glands may burst into the skin and produce cysts. Recently health practitioners are associating acne with a fungus on the face. A clogged colon can also contribute to acne. We recommend using a colon cleanser like Oxy-Powder to keep the bowel clean. How Can I Cure Acne? Home Remedies •A non-oily face wash that contains tea tree oil or echinacea can help to reduce the incidence of acne breakouts. Wash your face twice a day in the morning and evenings and rinse thoroughly with warm purified water. •Avoid oily and chemically ridden cosmetics or any facial products that contain socetyl stearate, isopropyl isostearate, isopropyl palmitate, isopropyl myristate, and sodium chloride, parabens as these ingredients can cause acne. •Give dry skin extra care, being sure to wash and rinse your face thoroughly and using products especially made for dry skin. •Natural astringent cleansers work to remove the oil buildup that may become blocked in the skin's glands.

Medication Conventional acne medications may be topical- applied directly to the skin- or they may be systemic- taken internally. Medications include benzoyl peroxide, retinoic acid, steroids, antibiotics, oral contraceptives, and isotretinoin (Accutane.) Therapeutic Injections In severe cases of acne where cysts form and scars have developed, doctors have had some success with injecting steroids directly into the cyst to resolve the cysts and diminish the appearance of scars. Surgery In moderate to severe cases of acne, doctors may use surgery to open up the blemishes and remove blackheads and whiteheads.

Depending on the severity and amount of scarring, multiple treatments may be needed in order to effectively minimize the lasting effects of acne.  The problem that many sufferers face is finding a way to pay for removing acne scars if their medical insurance does not cover the cost of treatment. Because removing acne scars may be considered, by some insurance providers, as a cosmetic procedure, it may be difficult to get an approval.  If you are considering a procedure that will aid in removing acne scars, the best way to learn if your medical insurance covers this type of treatment is to review your policy.  Whether your insurance is provided through your employer or you obtained it directly from an insurance provider, you should have a detailed overview of your coverage.  Many providers do not cover the cost of cosmetic treatments and/or surgeries, which are often deemed as cosmetic or plastic surgery.  If you still have questions after reviewing your policy, call your insurance agent to inquire about coverage. If coverage is in question, it may help to have your physician provide a written recommendation to your insurance company.  This letter should include the physician’s name, contact information and his/her determination and recommendation regarding treatment to help in removing acne scars.  Once this letter is submitted to your insurance company, a response should be given within 30 days.  This can either be to the physician directly or to you, but the insurance company will reply with an acceptance or denial. In the event that you request for medical insurance coverage relating to removing acne scars is denied, there may still be other options.  For instance, if your condition warrants laser surgery for removing acne scars, the hospital may offer a payment plan to help cover the cost of the procedure.  Many hospitals provide this type of financing to help their patient’s afford treatment that would otherwise be unavailable to them due to lack of medical insurance.  In order to be granted a payment plan, you would have to first determine whether or not one is available.  This can be found at the hospital’s billing office.  If payment plans are available, your physician would have to determine a total cost for removing acne scars and provide it to the billing office.  Following the procedure, the hospital would issue a bill and, if you are signed up on a payment plan, would give you the opportunity to make low monthly payments.

There are different approaches for acne treatment each with a specific purpose in mind. Two major reasons behind acne treatments are to clear the skin from lesions and breakouts and to treat scarring. These are the most significant inspirations for finding an appropriate approach. The topical acne treatment is also designed to remove oils and bacteria that are present in pimples. The topical medicine pulls the dirt and oil out of the pores helping the affected area to dry up quickly. These medicines are also effective in reducing inflammation associated with many acne breakouts. The reduction of redness and swelling make the pimples less noticeable. Dermabrasion is an example of a relatively simple approach to treating shallow scars. The skin is massaged with a rotating brush that removes the surface scars. The chemical peel is an acne treatment that removes scars using chemicals that slather off the scarred skin. More invasive approaches include scar excisions that remove the scar and pull the healthy skin together and punch grafting. Punch grafting involves removing the scar with a surgical hole-punch. The open plug where the scar originally was is filled with a plug of new skin. Hopefully, an acne treatment is designed that will eliminate the necessity of surgical approaches to remove scars, but for now these are very valuable for those suffering from acne scars. Many professionals recommend using a medication applied directly to the affected area. There are a variety of topical medicines designed as acne treatment. These products exfoliate the skin. The upper layer of skin is often covered with dead cells that work to obstruct the pores. When the skin is exfoliated, the dead layer of skin is washed away, leaving a fresh new layer that is less likely to obstruct. Just about everyone has acne at one time or another. This common skin problem has left many individuals looking for an effective acne treatment that can be used by a wide variety of people. Pimples are not selective; they tend to appear on anyone and everywhere. This prompts many researchers to work towards finding the ideal acne treatment. The first purpose of clearing the skin from lesions and breakouts is probably the more popular reason behind finding the best acne treatment. One rule of thumb is to only wash the affected area twice each day. Aggressive washing can irritate the skin and make the condition worse. After the skin is cleared, many people find themselves carrying around a few scars. Another purpose for acne treatment is to prevent or even heal scarring. Because scars vary in severity, the approaches vary as well. Some are quite simple while others are quite invasive. The individual chooses which acne treatment is appropriate according to the severity of the scarring.

I have had to deal with bad skin ever since I was a teenager, so I am very familiar with the shame and embarrassment that comes from having a face covered in a red rash. One unique characteristic about this skin problem is the fact that sometimes it doesn't clear up completely, and in extreme cases, can even lead to scarring. This happened to me, which meant that I was faced with the possibility of carrying around reminders of my skin troubles for my entire life. Fortunately, however, I discovered several rosacea laser treatments that have worked wonders. Of course, my dermatologist had been mentioning the possibility of rosacea laser treatment to me for years, but financial difficulties prevented me from following through. Because my insurance company considered rosacea laser treatments elective cosmetic procedures, I would have had to pay for everything out of pocket and the expense was simply too great at the time. But, as is usually the case, things have changed with time. Now rosacea laser treatment are more common and more affordable than ever before. From what I was able to see, they are more effective as well. So I finally decided to take the plunge and get the rosacea laser treatment that I'd been putting off for so long. The first thing I had to do was decide which treatment method would be best for me. As you might expect, there are several different kinds of rosacea laser treatment available on the market, so I had to do some research on the subject. I discovered that choosing the right one comes down to a combination of factors, including the severity of the scarring and the amount of money I was willing to spend. In cases where the scarring is more or less superficial, over-the-counter creams and ointments may be able to help. For more serious cases, advanced rosacea laser treatment such as prescription medications and laser therapy. Another thing I learned is that rosacea laser treatment can help lessen the effects of scarring, but most likely won't remove the scars completely. Even so, I saw dramatic improvements in the before and after photos that my dermatologist showed me during my consultation. But my dermatologist also reminded me that each patient's case is different, and that results will almost certainly vary from person to person. Nevertheless, I had already made up my mind to undergo rosacea scar treatment. Overall, I have to say this was one of the best decisions I have ever made. I am happy to report that my skin's appearance did improve as a result of the rosacea laser treatment I chose, and now I feel like a whole new person. If your skin is causing you embarrassment and preventing you from enjoying your life, I recommend checking out some rosacea laser treatment today.

","keywords":" scalp acne, scalp folliculitis, acne treatment, acne necrotica miliaris, acne scars, dermatologist ","article_body":" Scalp acne, the mildest form of which is also known as scalp folliculitis, occurs more frequently than most people realize. Just about everyone knows what acne is and that it commonly breaks out on the face, chest, arms and on the back. But acne also appears on other parts of the body as well, and unless you're someone with acne in one of these 'other' areas, you may not have realized this. Scalp acne and those similar to it, are often triggered during periods of great stress. This irritating scalp condition usually develops when the scalp becomes oilier than usual, for example when the hair isn't washed as frequently or when hair care products that contain a considerable amount of oil are used. Scalp acne can be very itchy and therefore makes it very difficult for those who have it to leave it alone. In its mildest form, the pustules are small, crusty, and they're sore. They appear mainly on the upper forehead at the hairline. A person can have just a few pustules or there can be many. A more severe form of scalp acne called acne necrotica miliaris is characterized by inflamed larger papules with black-colored crusts. This form of acne can leave behind scars that resemble those resulting from Chicken Pox. There is an even more severe form of scalp acne that primarily affects adult African-American men, but can actually affect anybody, regardless of race or sex. This extremely rare condition is a combination of large cysts and smaller pustules and papules that grow to be very large. <b>Treatment for Scalp Acne</b> Mild forms of scalp acne can be treated the way most other acne is treated. Keep the affected area clean by using a product that contains salicylic acid. Remember though that these products can cause excessive <i>dryness</i> so use only on affected areas. For better control, apply using a cotton wool or ball. Since oily hair is a contributing factor to scalp acne, it is imperative to use shampoo that's formulated for oily hair. Hair care products designed specially to treat seborrhea have also been used with reasonable success. And since many people use more than just shampoo on their hair, it's a good idea to check the labels on all hair care products and make changes as necessary. Never attempt to treat the more severe forms of scalp acne without consulting a dermatologist or doctor first. One thing that should not be used to treat scalp acne is any product that contains benzoyl peroxide. That's because when peroxide comes into contact with hair, it can change the color of the hair and result in a 'less-than-desirable' look! Those who have chemically-textured hair (for example those with perms) or color-treated hair are most prone to hair trouble when benzoyl peroxide comes into contact with hair.

First, acne occurs when for some unknown reason or combination of reasons, hair follicles, also known as pores, become blocked. Although the exact combination of reasons that pores become clogged may not be fully known, many contributing elements for teenagers and adults alike can include; genetics (whether or not there is a history of acne problems and if so, to what extent), hormones, dietary and vitamin make up (or lack of /deficiency) and stress related factors. Other denominators could include factors like how your body normally rids itself of its dead skin cells and influences that may be working against this regularity (for example climate and other environmental forces or overall body health at the time) and your hormones and their effect on your own body's sebum production (especially for females). Second, the normal dead skin cells that combine with your body's natural sebum oil as it drains through the skin's surface become clogged in these blocked pores. This substance becomes somewhat sticky, further clogging the passageway. Third, bacteria begins to grow around these clogged areas. As a normal reaction your, your body's white blood cells attack the bacteria, fighting it and pushing it out of the body. And forth, the resulting growths during this 14-day to 21-day battle are called microcomedones. Microcomedones turn into comedones, commonly referred to as blemishes, pimples or acne. There are basically four types of acne; whiteheads, blackheads, pimples and nodules. Whiteheads are when the sebum (oil) and resulting bacteria are trapped below the skinÕs surface and you can actually see a white head appear above (or near popping out of) the skin. Blackheads are when the sebum and resulting bacteria are only partially trapped, slowly draining out the surface and turning black because of your skinÕs melanin or pigmentation. In the absence of either white or blackhead are generally (but not always) smaller pimples. And the often deeper, boil-like lesions are referred to as nodules. All forms of acne can be mild, moderate or severe. Typically, mild acne is visible in the form of whiteheads and blackheads, sometimes pimples. With moderate acne, more pimples and pustules are present on the face, some may appear on the back or chest. And with severe acne, many nodules develop, often large and sore, over parts of the face, back, chest and other body areas. This type of acne can lead to scarring. Actually, lesser cases of acne have been followed by scarring. So for those with possible nodular acne, seeking advice from a healthcare provider as soon as possible is recommended. A gender issue to note is that males more often have the severe form of acne rather than females, due to their hormones. And the areas where they tend to break out most frequently are unfortunately more difficult to treat, the chest and back.

Many individuals turn to an over-the-counter acne treatment and, while there is no blanket system that works for everyone, these products often provide beneficial results. In order to ensure safety during the use of any acne treatment, individuals are urged to read the instructions carefully and pay close attention to any warning labels. During the first use of any acne treatment, whether it be in the form of a lotion or pad, consumers are urged to apply the medication to a small portion of the skin before proceeding with application to the rest of the area. In some cases, an acne treatment product may cause irritation to the skin, which may be minimized by applying the medication to a small test area. This process is not exclusive to the first use of the product and may actually be used before each application. Even if irritation does not present itself at first, it may later appear in future applications. In an instance of a prolonged or extreme case of acne, it may be necessary to consult a dermatologist for an appropriate acne treatment. These physicians are educated toward the treatment of skin and related illnesses, which allows them the advantage of recommending a customized treatment program. If a commercial acne treatment is not helping, there may be no use in continuing to subject the skin to that specific product. Instead, a dermatologist may be able to prescribe an acne treatment that is available by prescription only. In addition to commercial and/or prescription treatments, there are a number of home remedies that can be applied toward acne treatment. By avoiding contact or a disturbance to the acne prone area, individuals will lessen the chance of infection or added redness. In addition, washing the face both morning and night may help to ease the presence of acne. Exfoliation products may also help to rid the skin\u0012s surface of bacteria and dead skin cells, both of which may cause acne or clogged pores. A quality exfoliation product will reveal the healthy skin cells and rid the face of the old ones.

However, some of these myths are downright misleading and can even cause acne conditions to worsen. This article provides  insight and information about serious skin care for acne-prone skin by dispelling several acne myths  that can misguide people in their quest for clearer, acne-free skin. ","keywords":" serious skin care ","article_body":" When it comes to acne, a lot of information is available from different sources. Old wives' tales,   random experiments, and even misguided practices that promise instant cures for acne are followed by many in the hopes of being pimple-free. Unfortunately, some, if not all, of these are without scientific basis and can even make acne worse. Serious skin care for acne-prone skin starts with the right and proper information. On causes of acne There are a lot of myths concerning the causes and treatment for acne. Below are just some of the most popular and widely practiced acne myths * Stress Stress does not cause acne but it can make acne worse. Scientific studies show that stress can affect a person's hormonal cycle which can make the existing acne condition worse. Also, some psychiatric medicines taken to reduce stress can acne as a side effect. * Masturbation or sex Sex or masturbation does not cause acne. Studies done to relate sex or masturbation to acne are inconclusive with no additional evidence. An old wives' tale, this acne myth became popular during the early 17th century to discourage women from engaging in pre-marital sex or other scandalous behavior. Some misleading adults even use the fear of having acne to discourage adolescents of today from engaging in sex at an early age. * Chocolates and oily food Although eating too much of sweets and oily food is never good for anybody, the relationship between acne and this food group is largely indirect. Hormonal changes, which is the most common cause of acne,  may cause a person to alternately crave sweet and salty food like chocolates and chips. Since this craving often coincides with acne flare ups, this food group has been misleadingly labeled as a cause of acne. On cures for acne If myths on the probable causes of acne are abundant, there are also many so-called cures that promise instant freedom from acne. These are * Frequent face washing Since excess oil and dirt are among the causes of acne, some people have this misguided notion that frequently washing one's face can prevent and treat acne. However, this is not the case. Doing so only worsens acne since the skin is stripped off protective lipids which can make it sensitive, dry, and prone to irritations. * Toothpaste Toothpaste has antiseptic properties which can cause a pimple to dry out. However, while applying toothpaste to acne may be effective to some, it can cause greater damage to others especially if applied for over time. Toothpaste can dry out surrounding areas and “burn” pimple spots which can lead to discolorations. * Sun exposure Probably one of the most idiotic acne myth to surface, some people swear by this. However, sun exposure can only lead to one thing skin damage. Tans and darker skin tones only hide or camouflage acne but a closer look and touch will reveal bumps and zits. This can make the acne situation worse since sun exposure can make one's skin dry, flaky, discolored, and extra-sensitive. Eating a balanced diet, exercising, getting enough rest, and following a skin care regimen specific to one's skin type are essential for serious skin care of acne-prone skin. Medications and treatments prescribed by a dermatologist can also help greatly. "},{"title":" Should You Get Medical Help For Your Acne?

","word_count":860,"summary":" Fortunately, there are many over the counter (OTC) medications available to help people deal with acne. How well they work for you will pretty much be determined by three factors which are detailed in the article. ","keywords":" Acne Treatment, acne products, acne medication, acne Breakout, skin care ","article_body":" Copyright 2006 Tony Buel Everyone deals with acne at some stage in their life. Some will experience it worse than others. Some forms of acne will be more mild than others. The vast majority of people will, however, be in the middle somewhere. Although there may not be a direct linkage, acne may be aggravated by factors such as stress, diet, air quality and life-style choices. But the main factors causing acne are hormonal imbalances and genetics. Everyone, at some time in their lives will go through a period of time when their hormones seem to get messed up (puberty and pregnancy are prime examples) and if acne is your genetic trait -- you're stuck with it. Fortunately, there are many over the counter (OTC) medications available to help people deal with acne. How well they work for you will pretty much be determined by three factors the product's active ingredients, the cause of the user's acne and the user's skin type. Not all acne products will work the same way because of the different ingredients used. The active ingredient salicylic acid works by reducing the amount of dead skin. The active ingredient benzoyl peroxide works by reducing the P.acnes bacteria (a naturally occurring bacteria in the skin). Following are descriptions of the active ingredients you will find used in most over-the-counter acne medications Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide is the 'wonder drug' in the acne treatment industry; it works by reducing the natural P.acnes bacteria and reduces the quantity of dead skin cells. By performing these two actions, benzoyl peroxide manages to lessen the effects of two of the main causes of comedones (the large, deep, pus-filled pimples that are the trademarks of acne). Benzoyl peroxide has been used for years in acne treatment medications since being discovered to be very effective in treating mild acne. You will find (on the Internet) many 'personal' recommendations for benzoyl peroxide and details about how it was used to successfully treat acne. But as with all medications, use an acne product with benzoyl peroxide as instructed on the product label or as instructed by a physician. Benzoyl peroxide, when over-used, has the side-effect of drying out your skin and can also discolor any fabrics or materials it comes into contact with, e.g., shirts, towels, sheets, etc.. Benzoyl peroxide is available as a lotion or gel and can be used as a preventative acne treatment even after your acne has cleared up. Alcohol and acetone Alcohol and acetone are used together in some over-the-counter acne medications. The alcohol kills external bacteria while the acetone makes the skin less oily. \"Herbal\", \"organic\" and \"natural\" products You will find some OTC products with labels such \"herbal,\" \"organic\" and \"natural;\" these products are generally put on the market to appeal to the people who are attracted to products with those labels. The products themselves may or may not be beneficial for acne and actual results have proven inconclusive. Resorcinol The active ingredient resorcinol has been found to work well on small acne blemishes and can be found in some OTC products combined with sulfur. Sulfur itself has been used in a number of OTC medications for decades. You will find this usually in combination with active ingredients such as alcohol, salicylic acid and resorcinol. Sulfur has been found be an effective acne treatment for some people but it does not seem to be known exactly how it works to clear up acne. Also, products with sulfur will tend to have an unpleasant smell. Salicylic acid The active ingredient salicylic acid is generally effective for acne blemishes when there is no inflammation present. Salicylic acid acts by unclogging clogged-up pores to reduce the number of acne blemishes formed -- it does this by minimizing the amount of dead skin cells; it has no known effect on the production of sebum or the production of the P.acnes bacteria. Just as is recommended with products containing benzoyl peroxide, products with salicylic acid as the active ingredient should be used even after the acne clears up to prevent its return. One possible side-effect of salicylic acid is skin irritation in some people. Remember -everyone's skin is different! Some people have generally dry skin, some have generally oily skin and most people have a combination of the two on different areas on our bodies. Acne in areas of oily skin will respond better to a gel based acne product. Acne on dry skin will respond better to a cream. Those with sensitive skin should not use real strong acne medication. It may lead to skin irritation or even make your acne worse! Some of the milder acne treatments can be used as a preventative measure and some (like those with benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid) are recommended as post-acne preventative measures but many are too strong and will irritate your skin. If you have anything but a mild, seemingly manageable case of acne, an OTC medicine may control it and eventually get rid of it. If, however, your acne seems out of control or painful or too stressful to handle by yourself, be sure to see a get to a dermatologist!

Here are those techniques. Follow these suggestions and stay away from acne. Regularly wash your face Wash your face with a mild cleanser three times a day. Also wash your face after heavy exercise. Generally, some people with acne try to stop outbreaks and oil production by scrubbing their skin using strong detergent soaps and rough scrub pads. Though scrubbing will not improve acne; it can make the problem worse. Importantly, don’t forget to rinse your skin after washing. Shaving and acne Those who have acne can use electric or safety razor which is more comfortable for them. Guys who use a safety razor should use a sharp blade. They should soften their beard thoroughly with soap and water before applying shaving cream. Nicking blemishes can be avoided by shaving lightly and only when necessary. Don’t handle your skin frequently People who squeeze, pick or pop their zits develop scars or dark blotches on their face. They should also avoid rubbing and touching their skin lesions. Avoid sunburn and suntan Many of the medications used to treat acne can make a person more likely to sunburn. Sunburn that reddens the skin or suntan that darkens the skin may make blemishes less visible and make the skin feel drier. But these benefits are only temporary. And, there are known risks of excessive sun exposure such as more rapid skin aging. There is risk of developing skin cancer too. Tips for choosing makeup If you are getting treatment for acne you need to change some of the cosmetics you use. Cosmetics you use should be oil free. It will be hard to apply foundation evenly during the first few weeks of treatment. It is because the skin becomes red or scaly with the use of topical tretinoin or benzoyl peroxide. Oily hair products may eventually spread over the forehead and cause closed comedones. So it is advisable to use products that are labeled as noncomedogenic. And, in some people, even these products may cause acne. So it is necessary to take extra care with makeup.

This means keeping the skin clean and protecting it from damage from sunshine and harsh cosmetics. ","keywords":" acne, acne medication ","article_body":" Caring for your skin is important for good health and beauty, but especially so if you are prone to acne. One of the best ways to keep acne under control is to maintain your skin's health as much as possible. This means keeping the skin clean and protecting it from damage from sunshine and harsh cosmetics. Cleansing Your Skin Wash your face twice a day with a gentle soap or special acne skin cleanser, using a gentle, circular motion of the fingertips. Do not scrub, since this can aggravate acne. Moisten the face with warm water, then apply cleanser from the hairline to the neck. Rinse with lots of water and pat dry with a soft towel. Those with especially oily skin may need to use an astringent, but it must be alcohol-free, and used with care. Apply it only to the oiliest parts of the face and discontinue use immediately if your skin becomes irritated. If you feel you need an astringent, you may need to see a dermatologist instead. Hair care is also important -- shampoo twice a week to as often as daily, keeping the shampoo away from your face as much as possible. Protect Your Skin From The Sun A suntan may dry your skin, making the acne less noticeable, but this is only temporary. As your skin becomes accustomed to sun exposure, the acne will flare up again. Meanwhile you are risking skin damage that can cause premature aging and skin cancer. Many medications that treat acne cause the skin to become more sensitive to sunlight and more vulnerable to burning. Whatever the weather, you should wear sunscreen on your face and any other exposed skin when outdoors. Choose Makeup With Care The best choice for good acne skin care is to wear no makeup at all. But if you feel you must wear makeup, choose products labeled noncomedogenic -- that means they will not clog your pores. Be aware that these products may still cause acne in some people. Above all, avoid makeup with an oil base. Read the labels carefully and use sparingly. Shaving Try both electric razors and safety razors to see which causes the least irritation to skin blemishes. Always use a sharp blade in a safety razor -- change the blade every 2 or 3 shaves. You may have to shave around blemishes to avoid cutting them. Be sure to soften the beard as much as possible with warm water and shaving cream before starting. If your skin is covered with blemishes, perhaps it is best to skip shaving that day. No Touching As tempting as it may be to squeeze pimples, don't! That invites more trouble by spreading the bacteria which cause pimples. It can also lead to permanent scarring. Try to avoid touching your face as much as possible because the hands carry dirt, oil and germs. Rest assured that acne can be brought under control. Medications will go a long way toward clearing your skin of acne. Your job is to help the healing process along as much as possible by taking good care of your skin.

The best time for acne sufferers, or anyone, to wash their skin is in the morning and the evening and following any exercise program.  In caring for skin, many acne sufferers believe it’s better to scrub their skin in hopes of getting it clean.  However, this is not a good idea.  If you already suffer from acne, scrubbing will only make the condition worse and may cause irritation to your otherwise healthy skin.  Instead, gently washing the skin with a soap that does not contain harsh ingredients and contains some type of moisturizing lotion may help to cleanse and rejuvenate without the potential for irritation. Individuals who notice the presence of acne should avoid the temptation to pick, squeeze or pinch their blemishes.  This action may lead to scarring or even infection if not left alone to heal.  In addition, acne breakouts should not be touched or rubbed in order to avoid irritation.  Individuals should also avoid a sunburn or suntan for the sole purpose of concealing acne.  Because either of these two darkens the skin, many believe that this will lessen the visibility of their breakout.  While this may be true, it is also very temporary and it’s important to note that prolonged exposure to the sun or tanning bed may increase the risk of early aging signs, developing skin disorders or even cancer later on in life. If they are makeup wearers, individuals who are being treated for acne may wish to reconsider their choice in cosmetics.  Any type of product that is used, including foundation, moisturizers, eye shadow and bush should be oil free.  It can sometimes be difficult to evenly apply cosmetics when acne is present.  The reason is because it’s nearly impossible to get a smooth application when your skin has red bumps or inflammations.  The best way to conceal blemishes is to dampen a makeup sponge before dipping it into the foundation.  Once the foundation is present on the dampened sponge, it should be evenly applied over the face.  This technique will provide better coverage for acne sufferers and will result in a much smoother look than just using a dry application. When some people think of skin care, they feel that they couldn’t possibly have the time to devote to making their skin look and feel great.  The truth is, however, that regular cleansing with the proper soap and choosing the right cosmetics can go a long way in improving the tone of your skin.  In addition, skin care is linked to other factors, including diet and exercise.  If you can maintain a well-balanced diet and participate in an exercise as simple as walking for 30 minutes a day, 3 days a week, your skin tone ay improve dramatically.

The acne pimples are part of the skin forming like wounds and cysts that occur as part of the changes a kid experiences in the process of puberty. Teenagers would seek counsel from any of their peers or even their parents about these pimples or they may choose to deal with it ignorantly. The following are the most common myths about acne that teenagers believe and the facts that oppose these ideas •\tWashing the face for many times Many believe that the more they wash their face the lesser pimples they get. This isn’t proper, this is called over washing. In fact, complications may result from over doing the routine since it will irritate the skin due to the use of harsh soaps. Acne occurs as a result of some foul changes such as dead skin cells inside the skin and doing something harsh on the surface of the skin wouldn’t make a difference. It is good to wash the face regularly but it must be done gently using a cleanser or mild soap. The number of washes should not exceed to two times a day. •\tPopping the pimple/s Some people just can’t wait for their pimples to vanish so they choose to pop it out. By doing this, the skin becomes vulnerable of infection, scarring, and even more pimples due to the bacteria that gets into the skin while popping the acne pimples out. •\tTanning for acne treatment Sunlight kills skin bacteria but it doesn’t mean that it is an alternative for treating acne pimples. In fact, if skin cells die out and result to dried skin then the skin produces more oil which is one of the factors that cause pimples. •\tDiet as one factor for getting acne Chocolate, coffee, oil, and sugar among many foods people eat do not, in any way, cause acne. No type of diet can cure acne but healthy lifestyle can certainly avoid infections caused by pimples. Some foods were actually proven to exacerbate acne only in cases of allergy but never were it proven to be the main cause. •\tLong hair complicates acne The cause of acne is bacteria and if the person’s hair is long and is not cleansed properly then it will definitely complicate acne. •\tGirls are more susceptible to having acne than boys Acne is commonly present among boys due to the male hormone called androgen which is dominant. The most disturbing myth about acne is its being contagious. People don’t have to fear friends who have acne because the bacteria that cause acne is basically contained by the skin and not in the surface. Acne is disturbing for growing individuals but it would become less disturbing if kids and teenagers know the facts and not the side lies. "},{"title":" Some Helpful Acne Tips ","word_count":664,"summary":" This article sheds some light on acne, causes of acne and some helpful acne tips. ","keywords":" acne,acuzine,acne products,accutane,skin care ","article_body":" What is Acne? Acne, most commonly known as pimples, is the worst nightmare for those too unfortunate to suffer. It is the most common skin disease today. In United States alone, nearly 60 million people are infected with acne, where 85 per cent of teenagers suffer from it. Acne is a disorder resulting from the action of hormones on the skin's oil glands (sebaceous glands), which leads to plugged pores and outbreaks of lesions commonly called pimples or zits. Acne lesions usually occur on the face, neck, back, chest, and shoulders. Acne can involve mild to severe outbreaks of pimples and cysts on the face and sometimes on the back, shoulders and chest. Here are several acne terms that can help you better understand acne. Comedos are simply a plugged and enlarged hair follicle. When a comedo is open, it is usually called a blackhead. When it is closed or deep into the skin, it is usually called whitehead. The whitehead differs in color from the blackhead because the opening of the plugged sebaceous follicle to the skin’s surface is closed or very narrow, in contrast to the distended follicular opening of the blackhead. Neither blackheads nor whiteheads should be squeezed or picked open, unless extracted by a dermatologist under sterile conditions. Tissue injured by squeezing or picking can become infected by staphylococci, streptococci and other skin bacteria. Cysts are lumps under the skin that have pus and other tissue in them, and they can be red, swollen and sore – but they do not come to a head like pimples do. Cysts can cause scarring and blotchy, uneven skin colour. Acne Tips It is very important that teenagers and their parents know that the care that they give to their skin cannot stop pimples from coming completely, and that if the acne is very bad, skin care is not likely to make any difference. There is also a lot of mis-information about skin care. • Washing the face should only be done once or twice a day, with a mild soap. The skin should not be scrubbed. • Washing hair the forehead can be oilier than other parts of the face, and have more pimples. The hair just above the forehead is also often oily. Oily hair probably does not cause acne on the forehead to be worse. Washing the hair often (such as daily) can make the hair look better, but may have no effect on the acne. If their forehead has a lot of acne, teenagers will want to cover it with their hair. This probably will not make the acne worse, and might be helpful in improving the way they feel about their face. • Pimples should not be squeezed, as this can damage the lining of the pore and the sebum and bacteria can get into the skin around the pimple, causing more inflammation (redness, swelling and pus). However most teenagers cannot resist trying to squeeze out pus or a blackhead. If they have to, make sure they know that they should have clean hands, and only squeeze very gently. If the pus or blackhead does not come out easily, it is not ready to come out. • Exposing the face to a little sunlight, not enough to cause any skin damage, may help a little. • Avoiding cosmetics and sunscreens which are oil based might be worth trying. • There are many products for sale 'over the counter' at pharmacies, or in supermarkets, which are claimed to reduce or get rid of acne. Some of these may help. Many of them work by increasing the speed of production of cells lining the ducts and cells of the skin of the face. This can unblock the pores, or make them less likely to block. • Cheap products may be as helpful as more expensive ones. Some make the skin more sensitive to sunlight, so sun screen should also be used. If the product causes the skin to become very red or sore, stop using the product.

Currently there are two treatments that do work and one is actually cost effective. It is now a fact that acne can be treated, controlled and even cured. We must become more educated on what acne is and whqat does and does not cause it. Acne is an inflammation of the skin that is caused by overproduction of sebum (oil) from our sbaceous glands and a low skin pH (acidity) that make ideal conditions for bacteria. This bacteria clogs the pores and causes pimples and deeper inflammed bumps and postules (acne). Acne is genetic as it is first started by the overproduction of oil and acidity levels. Chocolate and sugary items don't cause it. Accutane (can only be prescribed) works by greatly reducing the production of sebum. This reduction in sebum will make the skin very dry and does have some bad side effects like possible liver damage and such so it is available only through your dermatologist and is used as a drastic or last measure. Basically it brings out all the acne you will have in the next 2-3 years all at once over the first 2 months and then it is all gone. The first 2 months are rough, however - I had this treatment. TCA peels are a more affordable and less drastic alternative. TCA peels work by cleansing the skin, increasing the pH or acidity of the skin making it unfavorable for bacteris, and increasing the rate of skin regeneration thus hastening the healing process. TCA Peels work 1,000 times better than any overrated peroxide wash or cleansing system and have similar results to Accutane without any of the harsh side effects. They have been rated as one of the best at home products / treatments available. This has been proven on millions of patients - why else would every dermatologist and plastic surgeon offer TCA peels? So, basically, you can either live with the scurge of acne or treat it. TCA peels are the most cost effective and least harmful solution to acne and can now be purchased directly instead of through your doctor for tremendous savings.

At first the redness may last for just a few hours, but later as the condition progresses and recurrences continue, the color persists and can become permanent. ","keywords":" acne rosacea, acne, acne vulgaris, bulbous nose, pimples, laser treatment, tetracycline, rhinophyma, sebaceous glands, causes, surgery, complications ","article_body":" Signs and Symptoms of Acne Rosacea There are certain contrasts between acne rosacea and acne vulgaris. As you probably know, acne vulgaris is the most common form of acne which seems to start with the onset of puberty and is characterized by the formation of whiteheads and blackheads. Acne rosacea, on the other hand, usually makes its first appearance between the ages of 30 and 50, is confined to the face --  mostly the nose, cheeks, chin, forehead and eyelids -- and is not associated with overactive oil glands. The lesions seen in acne rosacea consist of erythema, minute dilated blood vessels, papules and pustules. The color of the skin in the affected areas varies from bright to dull red, or it can even take on a purplish hue. At first the redness may last for just a few hours, but later as the condition progresses and recurrences continue, the color persists and can become permanent. The hypertrophy of the sebaceous glands, especially on the nose, leads to thickening of the skin, increased visibility of the expanded follicles and an enlargement of the nose, so often associated with acne rosacea. Although most commonly seen in women, men have the most severe cases and are the ones that usually develop the disfiguring bulbous nose, known as rhinophyma. Oddly, sometimes rhinophyma is the only sign of the condition. People suffering from acne rosacea come to realize what aggravates their particular outbreaks and avoid them, if possible. The most common stimulants are hot, spicy foods, hot beverages and alcohol. Exposure to the sun and to heat also seems to be aggravating factors. Acne rosacea is not life-threatening, but it certainly does severely alter a person's appearance. Complications Associated With Rosacea There are only a few complications associated with acne rosacea. Sometimes, eye irritations can occur due to inflammation of the eyelashes or outer surface of the eyes. The membrane covering the lens (cornea) can become inflamed leading to impaired vision, but this rarely happens. Treatment Options for Acne Rosacea Topical and Oral Medication. There is no proven cure for rosacea since the exact cause of the disease is not known. Successful treatment is based on controlling the acne-like symptoms with the same topical and systemic medications used in treating regular acne. The most effective treatment to date includes long term use of topical and oral antibiotics such as tetracycline which does seem to control the eruptions. The dosage of the antibiotic is slowly lowered to maintain control. In most cases, it can eventually be discontinued altogether without recurrence of the rosacea pimples. Of course, tetracycline should never be taken during pregnancy since the medication does affect the unborn child. Laser and Surgery. Laser treatment has been successful in eliminating the enlarged facial blood vessels. This is a treatment that causes very little discomfort. Also, surgery can be used to remove the excess tissue associated with rhinophyma. Other Treatment. The psychological and stress problems associated with acne rosacea should always be assessed and treated.  The symptoms and severity are varied and can, at times, require the attention of a medical specialist.

It whisks away old skin cells and unclogs pores. Here’s what to do <b>After cleaning face and rinsing completely</b> cover face with soothing acidic oil – such as olive oil. <b>Apply granulated sugar</b>; the oil acts as a medium; holding it on the face, preventing the face from being scraped or scratched. <b>Gently roll the “sand” mixture across the skin</b>; do not press, do not rub too briskly. Use small circular motions, not sweeping ones. Be careful not to press hard, or stretch the skin. <b>After sugar dissolves</b>, about one minute, use warm water and a good cleanser to wash the solution away. Rinse at least a dozen of times to thoroughly remove alkaline residue. Using this method to exfoliate your skin once in the morning and again in the evening is an effective remedy for acne because it “peels” away dead skin cells, and removes bacteria-attracting debris that clogs pores. It also speeds up new cell growth for younger looking skin; mature complexions look radiant and more youthful. This technique is safer than a chemical peel and less irritating to the skin than a deep skin peel. Visible benefits are immediately realized; dramatic results seen in about three weeks. <b>Variation 2</b> Another variation involves omitting the olive oil. Instead, dampen washcloth with warm water. Add a mild facial cleaning agent; I like Clean & Clear Foaming Facial Cleanser for Sensitive Skin. It is an inexpensive yet effective cleaner. Add ½ to ¾ tablespoon sugar. Apply to damp face, using same circular method described above to exfoliate. Rinse well. Apply moisturizer of choice. Using a mild liquid facial cleanser instead of olive oil is quicker, because it omits the need to follow with a second application of cleaner. <b>Other Benefits</b> Other benefits of this home-remedy exfoliating cleansing method are this sugar is a natural substance, procedure is simple and inexpensive; sugar benefits the skin because it attracts moisture. Sugar granules are safer than (let’s say) granulated fruit pits, because they dissolve. Lastly, and most importantly, a sugabrasion really works!  It is one sweet remedy for acne prone skin, and adds a healthy glow to your complexion for younger looking skin. ©2006 Lori S.

This is the perfect moment to put your worries aside and join your friends for a week-end at the beach, a party blasting its way late into the night or a day of lazing in the sun. All around, people are looking for ways of avoiding the daily chores and routine so they can grab some fun and relaxation time. However, going to the beach is an activity that tends to raise some problems of its own, especially for people suffering from acne. While being out in the sun, lying on a beach towel and enjoying the wind in your hair and the sight of the sea is one of the best pastimes ever, you should keep in mind that the combination of wind-borne sand and UV rays is not good for your skin. This means that your beach kit should include some skincare items in order to prevent a worsening of your acne due to exposure to the elements. And don't forget the ClearPores protection cream that will keep the pesky sand and dust from finding a new home in your pores. Many people think that getting a suntan helps fight acne, but this is actually a myth. It's true that tan drives pimples away, but that's only because ultraviolet rays burn the topmost layer of your skin to a nice crisp. As soon as that layer of skin is gone, the pimples will appear once more. And the same goes for sun beds and other artificial tanning devices. They operate on the same principle as natural tan and carry the same risks. Your best option is to get a sunscreen lotion because burning off your pimples at the risk of getting skin cancer is simply not worth it. Avoid oil-based sunscreens since the oil can clog your pores just as easily as sebum does. Wind-borne sand is another thing you should look out for. The combination of wind and sand dries out your skin and may block the pores, thus potentially worsening your acne. Be careful to cleanse your face after leaving the beach. The basic idea is that exposure to the dust, wind, sun and seawater are not likely to have positive effect on your condition. Bathing in the sea is lots of fun, but it's not without risk. Unlike tap water, sea water is salty and also contains a lot of chemicals that are not good for your skin. This doesn't mean that you should get paranoid and keep to the beach, but some precautions are in order. Just as recommended above, don't forget to cleanse your face and apply some protection cream when you get home. So make sure you can prevent and contain and possible bad effects of your trip to the beach. ClearPores is a good answer to all these problems. The deep body and face washes will unclog your pores and clear away any dirt and bacteria, while the herbal supplement will kill any tough bacteria from the inside. Finally, the protection cream is here to round up the acne destruction system by preventing future breakouts. This anti-acne system is the best solution you could hope for.

","keywords":" acne, benzoyl peroxide, acne treatment, proactiv, proactive, skin care ","article_body":" Anybody who’s ever had a run-in with acne probably knows that there’s a vast array of products out there that all claim to get rid of zits fast and effectively. Unfortunately, there’s just not that one miracle product out there that will cure everybody’s acne ailments. More often than not, a person who suffers from acne has to try and test out a variety of products before they find anything that really works with them. It can be a long and frustrating road to travel down at times. There are really a lot of factors when it comes to determining what causes acne in certain people. Cleanliness of the skin is one factor that is important but not the main cause. When experiencing acne breakouts, a clean, well moisturized face is essential to help prevent further attacks, but having a completely clean face at all times does not guarantee that it will be free of acne for all of that time. Diet is another widely ignored factor that is important when it comes to a clear complexion. The foods and drink a person consumes does have a direct effect on what is secreted through the skin. If someone has a diet that is high in fat, sugars, and preservatives, they have a much greater chance of experiencing acne breakouts. Another major factor that causes acne is an imbalance of hormones in the human body. Hormonal imbalances that cause acne in humans are primarily because of the bodies over or under production of sebum. Sebum is a substance found in the sebaceous glands that the body normally produces to lubricate and protect the skin from the environment. When there is either too much or too little of this sebum being produced, the pores and hair follicles can become dry and irritated, leading to acne breakouts.  Acne problems happen for women when there is either an overproduction of androgens or they are overly sensitive to the body’s natural level of those androgens. Another imbalance can be an underproduction of estrogen; the chemical found in females that counteracts the effects of androgens. Birth control pills contain two chemicals- estrogen and progestin, which are known agents in maintaining a normal hormonal balance. Progestin is a pill that contains a synthetic version of the hormone progesterone. It is both helpful and harmful when it comes to acne on the skin. It is beneficial in that it bonds with the progesterone to maintain normal sebum production but is also known to cause the body to retain more water than usual, which can lead to bloating and blocked pores and hair follicles. The birth control pill helps to prevent excess androgen formation by reducing the amount found in the bloodstream and blocking them from the receptors or the sebaceous glands. This is why birth control pills are so effective in helping to prevent acne in so many women. Just like acne products, there are a multitude of birth control pills that are produced and manufactured for a variety of physical body types. In order to get on birth control pills, a woman must first consult a physician in order to find out what will be the best type for her personal needs. Pills come in a variety of brand names and ingredients and range in a number of strengths. A physician will be the most helpful in determining which is the appropriate type. If you are a woman who is suffering from acne, you may benefit from looking into the use of contraceptive pills to help fight off future acne breakouts.

","article_body":" Acne is not confined to teenagers and puberty, it also prevalent in adults and in women mostly during pregnancy.  Acne is often characterized by pimples and breakouts all over the skin in large numbers, frequently seen on the face and the back.  It is caused due to the over activity of the sebaceous glands or the oil producing glands.  When it combines with dead skin cells, hormones and bacteria, the oily substances are trapped inside the pores and causes swelling.  The lumps often have a crown of a white head or a black head or even red lumps, which are very tender.  Acne, if not treated on time, can even lead to scarring.  Some acne go so deep inside the skin that they form into nodules and cysts, which leaves scars which may not disappear even after healing.  Acne can be caused due to stress, fatigue, and cosmetics and even due to humidity, although nothing has been proved till date. <b> Do’s and Don’ts on the acne prone skin</b> Professional treatment is the best for acne, the earlier the treatment provided, the better.  A good doctor will be in a position to treat acne-using medications by controlling the over-active sebaceous glands, hormonal imbalance, or even stress. It is good not to squeeze or break the pimples and acne, as it will lead to spread the infection and can make the area swell and might even lead to permanent scarring. Usage of oily cosmetics are also not recommended, as the acne prone skin already is oily enough, usage of such cosmetics will add up to it.  Instead of using oily cosmetics, it is better to go for water based ones, which might be less harsh.  It is always good to remove make up at night, if left on the whole night might cause irritation to the skin. The acne prone skin should be pampered with gentle wash and pat dry.  Vigorous scrubbing needs to be avoided as it only worsens the condition and may even block the pores. Regular shampooing is recommended as it may reduce the pimple appearing on the forehead, it is good to avoid hair products like gels and pomades, as they are oily. Cosmetics which are non comedogenic should be used.  Acnes sometimes can make the skin hypersensitive, hence sunscreens can be used to avoid sunburns.  It is good to avoid tanning, as it cannot make the skin clearer. Over-the-counter products containing salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide can curb mild acne.

The global beauty industry already makes billions of dollars every year as women everywhere embark on quests to preserve (or achieve) a youthful, glowing appearance. Responding to this need, dermatologists, and other specialists continue to look for the best and safest possible treatments and formulations to combat skin ailments, the most common of which is acne. Apart from the services offered at skin clinics, many creams, gels and ointments that claim to treat acne, diminish sun or age spots and enhance skin elasticity are widely available in the market. There are scrubs, cleansers, masks, over-the-counter skin medicine and skin peel formulations, all offered at various price ranges. Most can be bought at department stores or drugstores, but the fact is that very few of these so- called “miracle” products actually work. And the latest medical research has shown that what does work as a proven treatment for acne, are skin peels. Plastic surgeon Dr. Keith Leiberman explains “Unlike other techniques, TCA skin peels get to the root of the problem with acne, resulting in tremendously effective results - leaving the patient with noticeably fresher, smoother skin and great texture…without the acne! ” The TCA peel, or trichloroacetic acid skin peel, is recommended by many doctors and skin specialists as it is a medium-strength treatment that is among the safest, most effective, as well as easiest to use. It sloughs off layers of dull dead skin that may cover up the source of acne. It also enhances the blood flow and circulation in the skin, promoting skin cell rejuvenation and the build up of skin-strengthening collagen and elastin. Conventional skin peel treatments that involve suction-type dermabrasion can cause further damage, as it can bruise the skin and break some small blood vessels. Those who wish to treat their acne and other skin problems with TCA can control the strength of the treatment by starting off with a weak solution and gradually working their way up to more concentrated mixtures as needed. TCA can be mixed with other previously prepared creams such as Obagi or applied directly. It is important to remember that TCA skin peels should not exceed more than 20 minutes on one’s skin. The time limit generally depends on the strength or concentration of the mixture and the type of skin. Because of the chemical content, doctors recommend applying a neutralizer, such as a simple mixture of baking soda and water, to calm and stabilize the skin after the TCA peel is applied. Users should wait about six months before applying another treatment. TCA peels are great for treating acne and less expensive than clinic or spa-based treatments. Websites such as www.bestskinpeel.com offer this effective product at a fraction of the price one would normally pay per session or treatment at salons and spas. The set offered by this particular website is priced at under $30.00 and includes one ounce of medical-grade 50%-concentrate TCA skin peel (good enough for about 30 treatments) as easy-to-follow instructions by a licensed practitioner. Why pay hundreds of dollars when you can do this treatment at home? Apart from the 50%-concentrate, many suppliers also offer as low as an 8%-concentrate TCA skin peel for users with more sensitive skin.

","keywords":" acne ","article_body":" Teens face many problems and acne is one of their major concerns. Changes in their physical appearance due to acne can range from mild to severe. Unfortunately this can prove difficult to treat. Additionally a number of psychological effects can manifest themselves due to the physical changes brought about by acne. Teens may become very self-conscious about their appearance and avoid social situations as they feel awkward about them. What social & psychological ramifications does suffering from acne bring?  Lets discuss some of the social aspects in-order to obtain a better understanding of the condition and gain a better understanding of the condition. The difficulties associated with acne aren’t fully understood by people who do not suffer with the condition and, as a result of this, they often allege that their acne suffering friends are over sensitive about the condition. However, the social and psychological effects being faced by people who suffer from acne have started to be studied more closely in the more recent years. Acne is not just about how you look, it has been found that how you feel plays a major role. Complying with high standards of appearance in a society where it is so important to be part of the “norm”. For teens this is very important. They want to live up to the “standards” that they believe their peers have and In a society where so much importance is placed on appearance and complying to the “norm”. High standards have been set concerning what people do and don’t accept.  For teens this is especially important.  Many teenagers face the pressures put on them by their peers, and appearance is just one of those standards by which they are judged. When asked, teens suffering from acne said they feel ugly and sometimes depressed.  These feelings can cross over into adult acne, and aren’t gender specific. It has been said that there is no other condition that causes more psychic or mal-adjustment between parent and child, more general insecurity, and feelings of inferiority. For a person in their teens it is important to gain a good understanding of the psychological effects associated with acne, this is especially so for teens whose self-worth is still being developed. It is difficult, however, to study these factors because of the many differences in both the causes and the severity of acne. Add to this the fact that the teenage years are already a difficult period of anyone’s life and it becomes difficult to separate the effects of acne from everything else. Listening is probably one of the best ways to understand the effects that acne is having on a teenager. This way you can find out how your teen is feeling about his or her acne and how they are coping. It is a good idea to reassure them and let them know that acne is very common amongst both teenagers and adults and can be caused by many things that effect many people. One of the myths regarding acne is that it is caused by not washing or poor general hygiene. This simply is not the case. Hygiene has very little to do with the cause of acne and suffering from it does not mean that your teen is dirty or has poor hygiene. The first step to feeling better about your appearance and yourself is to find out what type of acne and the cause of it. When you know this you can begin treating it.

","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" At least 90% of adolescents have acne — it affects teens of every size and shape, in every country from America to Zimbabwe. A recent study by the American Medical Association revealed (not surprisingly) that acne is one of today’s teenagers’ biggest worries. “Acne can, without question, affect self-esteem,” says Diane Berson, MD, Assistant Clinical Professor of Dermatology at New York University School of Medicine. “Some kids have it so severely that they don’t even want to go out of their house. They make excuses for not going to social functions.”1 It seems unfair, doesn’t it? Just when you’re beginning to grow up and get some ideas about exactly who’s behind the face in your mirror, you’re staring at a minefield of bumps and blemishes. It can be downright depressing — but since everyone has acne, you’re supposed to suck it up and suffer through it… right? Wrong! Today we know more about fighting acne than ever before. And the best way to stop acne is to find out why it starts when it does — during adolescence. Get rid of your acne with Proactiv® Solution - GO NOW! Why does acne strike teens? At the onset of puberty, the body begins to produce hormones called androgens. These “male” hormones are a natural part of development for both boys and girls, but boys tend to produce more of them — and therefore tend to have more severe breakouts. Why? Our faces and bodies are covered with tiny hairs, each one fitting snugly into a hair follicle, sometimes called a pore. Deep within each follicle, oil glands are hard at work producing sebum, which travels up the hair and out onto the surface of your skin. Sebum’s job is to form a protective layer between your skin and the world, keeping it soft and smooth. But when androgens enter the picture, your oil glands go into overdrive. They produce extra oil, which can clump together with the dead skin cells on the top layer of your skin. When this sticky mixture finds its way into your pores, it acts just like a cork in a bottle — trapping oil and bacteria inside. Unfortunately, your oil glands just don’t know when to stop; they keep producing oil, and the follicle becomes swollen. Your body’s natural defense system, white blood cells, rush to the area to clean up the mess. The result? Red, painful bumps. Yucky black spots. Zits. Blackheads. Pimples. Acne. It has nothing to do with what you eat, or how often you wash your face. How can I strike back against teen acne? The best way to zap zits is to prevent them from showing up in the first place! Following are a few simple practices than can help you minimize your breakouts. A Tip on Avoiding Teen Acne - Keep it clean. Since teenagers produce more oil, it’s important to wash twice a day with warm water and a mild cleanser. Since your skin does need some sebum in order to stay healthy, don’t be tempted to overwash; your glands could pay you back by producing more oil. Teen Acne Advice - Skip harsh scrubs. It's okay to exfoliate, but be sure to use a gentle formula with small, smooth grains. Avoid products with almond or apricot shell fragments; they can irritate or even tear your skin and further aggravate your acne. Avoiding Teen Acne - Say no to alcohol. If you use a toner, avoid products with high concentrations of isopropyl alcohol, or common rubbing alcohol. Alcohol strips the top layer of your skin, causing your glands to produce more oil. The result? Dry, flaky skin — and possibly more blemishes. Ways to Avoid Teen Acne - Don't squeeze or pick. Squeezing or picking your blemishes with fingernails, pins or anything else can force bacteria deeper into the skin. This can cause greater inflammation and infection, increasing the chances that your pimple will leave a permanent scar. Remember, a zit that’s bugging you today will go away if treated properly; if you pick at it, it may stick around forever. Being Smart about Teen Acne - Hands off! The bacteria that causes acne, Propionibacterium acnes, hangs out on your skin all the time; it doesn't lead to acne until it gets trapped inside the hair follicle. Touching your face, including rubbing or even resting your chin in your hands, can drive bacteria into your pores — where it can begin its dirtywork. Dealing with Teen Acne - Choose products wisely. If you wear make-up, be sure it’s oil-free and non-comedogenic — that means it won’t clog your pores and make your breakouts worse. The same goes for your sunscreen and even your hair products; sticky sprays, gels and pomades can aggravate acne, too. Getting Ahead of Teen Acne - Be smart about sun. If you think tanning helps your acne, you’re right — and wrong. Small amounts of sun exposure may improve acne for a few days. But suntans (and burns) also make you shed your dead skin cells faster, so in the long run, you’ll end up with more clogged pores. And that means more acne. Another thing you should know some kinds of acne medication make skin more sensitive to the sun. So if you’re headed outside in sunny weather, be sure to slather up with sunscreen. Look for sun protection products that are oil-free and have a “sun protection factor” (or SPF) of at least 15 for both UVA and UVB rays. Avoiding Teen Acne - Accessorize wisely. Heat and friction (rubbing) can cause acne flare-ups. So steer clear of hats and headbands — and if your sports team requires you to wear a helmet or any other equipment that might rub against your skin, try lining it with a layer of clean, soft cotton. And remember to shower immediately after exercising — don’t sit around in a sweaty uniform, no matter how cool you look. Teen Acne Treatment - Find a regimen and stick with it. Most cases of mild acne can be improved with \"over-the-counter\" products, or products that don't require a prescription from your doctor. There is a wide range of treatments available, and there’s a good chance one of them will work for you. If you start treatment before your acne gets severe, you’ll have a better chance of avoiding physical and emotional problems down the road. But if your acne gets worse or lasts more than a couple of weeks, see a dermatologist. Here's a quick listing of the most common products used to treat acne — click on the links that interest you for more information on that course of treatment. • Benzoyl Peroxide Kills the bacteria that causes acne. • Proactiv® Solution A dermatologist formulated Combination Therapy® acne management system.

Relax — it’s not your fault. The most important thing to remember about acne is that it’s not your fault. You didn’t make your face break out by eating too many french fries, wearing make-up or daydreaming about your crush. Now you know a few of the things that can aggravate acne in teenagers. But since acne is different for everyone, you should watch your own skin carefully for things that trigger breakouts — and avoid them. If your acne still hangs around, see a doctor.

There are hundreds of different treatments available today. Light to moderate cases of acne, that which include blackheads, whiteheads and papules, can usually be treated successfully with over the counter preparations. Most of these cleansers and scrubs and spot treatments contain salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. These generally work well. When washing your face do not scrub your skin. Don't use a washcloth. Scrubbing the skin can irritate acne and make it look and feel worse. Never pick or scratch the acne. This can cause scarring. Some of the over the counter preparations are extremely drying on the skin. Make sure you follow the manufacturers instructions for use. Over drying the skin isn't good as the skin may rebel against being over dry by producing more oil. More severe cases of acne that include cysts and nodules may need the help of a dermatologist. A dermatologist will evaluate many different things such as age, lifestyle and co-existing conditions. The dermatologist may suggest a combination of two or three different therapies to be used at the same time. A healthy diet may help your skin to improve, and it certainly is a wonderful lifestyle change. Eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables. Eat a diet high in fiber. Avoid refined sugar, hydrogenated oils and saturated fats. Drink at least six glasses of water a day.

It is noted that the more disfigurement accompanying the acne the higher the anxiety levels. Acne can have a (negative) psychological impact that can lead many teenagers to walk around carrying negative self-images that can stick with them and affect their beliefs and actions for the rest of their lives. Parents can be the crucial piece of the puzzle. Sensitivity from those closest to them can help teens be more self-accepting and do less self-flagellation for some supposed fault. Parents who tell their kids that they are beautiful, precious and special can provide an important psychological bridge over these turbulent feelings. Taking some “mirror time” to see beyond the pimples – while doing some positive self-affirmations can help too. In more severe cases, supportive psychotherapy or hypnotherapy can benefit any teenager who is willing to put in the time and the effort. It will be worth it. Several teenagers suffer emotional stress and fatigue brought on simply by being adolescents. Higher levels of hormones and adrenaline can result, which increases sebum production, and can eventually clog pores. Severe acne outbreaks have also been reported after prolonged sleep deprivation. Beauty sleep becomes more important than ever, as we know skin cells are nourished and rejuvenated during sleep. Exercise can not only increase blood circulation and bring more oxygen to the skin – it can also help soothe the mind and the emotions of teens bearing the agony of acne. In addition to plenty of sleep and exercise, relaxation techniques such as breathing exercises, yoga, self-hypnosis, meditation, or listening to relaxing music, have also been shown to be effective. Psychologists who work with teenage acne sufferers also see many sufferers in their 20s and 30s with difficult acne problems. It should be no surprise that many of these adults are still dealing with adolescent issues, such as sexual or professional identity, separation from parents, and repressed anger. Psychological help for adults coping with their teen issues can actually clear up their skin.

Acne is defined as an inflammatory skin eruption that commonly occurs in or near the sebaceous glands of the different parts of the body including the neck, face, shoulders, and upper back. Though acne is a common problem, it is also one skin disease that is very easy to treat and prevent. There are many products that a person could consider as the best acne treatment. The best acne treatment for a person could be not the best acne treatment for another. This is because the best acne treatment is determined by the type of skin a person has and the skin reaction on that treatment. The best acne treatment could also range from the medical ones which are proven best acne treatments that modern medicine has to offer up to herbal medicines that are also accepted as the best acne treatment to some people. Another thing that a person must consider before deciding on what could be their best acne treatment would be assessment of toxicity which excess of it could lead to harmful risks in the health of the customer. Here are some of the best acne treatments that have been tested and contain a low level of toxicity in it (meaning there is minimal or even no health risk in using it). First on the list of the best acne treatment would be Australian Tea Tree Oil. In the review conducted about this product, it was given a rating of .01 with a score range of 0 to 10, 0 as harmless and 10 as potentially harmful. In using this product, just add one or two drops of the product in cotton and apply it to the affected area. Do not use this product on the whole face because the results would not be good (curiosity killed the cat). So far, this has the number one spot as the best acne treatment. Next on the list of best acne treatments would be Desert Essence Blemish Touch Stick with Eco-Harvest Tea Tree Oil with a rating of 3.8. This best acne treatment consists of Witch Hazel Extract, grain alcohol, and different kinds of extracted oils (Eco-harvest Tea Tree Oil, Blue Chamomile, Rosemary, and others). In using this best acne treatment, a person must apply this to the blemishes and to even other skin irritations five to six times a day, which should be used daily. It is also recommended to use it with a clean facial wash. The third spot for the best acne treatment would be Burt's Bees Doctor Burt's Herbal Blemish Stick with Tea Tree Oil. This acne treatment was rated a 3.9 score. For the application of this product, one must apply this to the affected area and the good news about it is that there is no minimum application limit for this medication, which means it could be applied as many times as desired. The next best acne treatment is also similar with last one that I mentioned. It is known as Burt's Bees Healthy Treatment Parsley Blemish Stick with Willowbark. This best acne treatment apparently has the same rating with the latter one (3.9). The only difference in this product is the willowbark element. The procedure for applying this treatment is also the same as stated above. These are just some recommended best acne treatment that underwent a lot of research and study before they were declared as such. Though there are many other considered good acne treatments in the market, prevention is still the best way to overcome the acne issue.

This acne can be worsened by summer heat, improper cleaning, itching and picking at the bumps (they are not pimples and will only get worse when picked at), pH imbalance, bad nutrition, etc... By changing our habits we can improve this condition. Using mild soaps and cleansers will prove less irritating. Eating a well balanced diet will average out the condition and slowly improve it. And we all know not to pick at acne postules and bumps, but to stop it and possibly cure it we have to get to the source deep in the skin. Surface treatments like benzoyl peroxide creams and solutions are at best minimally effective and can further irritate the condition. We need to get several layers down to the source, the bacteria, inflamation, and the sebacious glands where acne forms. Plastic surgeons know that glycolic and salicylic peels are better than hydrogen peroxide treatments, but they will not reach the source. This is where plastic surceons and doctors use TCA peels (trichloroacetic acid) which is a deeper peel to reach the source, change the skin pH (which kills off the bacteria - they cannot survive in high acidity conditions), and increase skin regeneration by sloughing off several layers. TCA peels have been clinically prove to treat and cure acne better than any other treatment (including lasers and Accutane) without any of the horrible side effects). TCA peels used to be something only the wealthy could afford, but not anymore. You can still go to your doctor and pay $500+ or you can do it yourself. TCA peels are the easiest, safest, and most effective of all the skin peels and are now easily available. For more details about TCA peels contact the author below or look it up on the internet.

Let's face it; no one likes a face full of pimples, because they have a way of lowering your self esteem. But fortunately, there are several methods available for getting rid of this skin condition. I can bet not many people know of any method that can guaranty a total clear up acne. And the reason for this has to do with our skin types. Again, I can wager my monthly pay that most folks don't know their skin types either. I got to know mine when I was 19 years old. But a fact that is both glaring and disturbing is that males have oilier skins than females, which can only indicate one thing males are more susceptible to acne. Regarding your skin type, consulting a skin physician will help clarify this, and this doctor can also suggest ways to clear up acne, and prevent its reoccurrence. Acne are caused by the blockage of skin pores by dirt’s and oils, so the best way to prevent this skin blemish is to free the skin from the causative agents. If you find the subject of how to clear up acne confusing, you can turn to the Internet for assistance, of course using your computer or Mac. You can find one of the numerous products that really clear up acne very quick. One good product I recommend is Proactive Solution, but your physician can also prescribe an effective cream or pill. Other factors that can aid the process of removing skin blemishes is by following a healthy diet regimen and drinking plenty of water. Also the right amount of sleep can go a long way in keeping your body rejuvenated. Generally, you can clear up acne by living straight and adhering to the appropriate treatments for your skin blemishes.

Acne affects most teenagers to some extent.  However, the disease is not restricted to any age group; adults in their 20s - even into their 40s - can get acne.  While not a life threatening condition, acne can be upsetting and disfiguring.  When severe, acne can lead to serious and permanent scarring.  Even less severe cases can lead to scarring. Why does acne happen? - An inflamed spot occurs due to the release of inflammatory fatty acids by a particular bacterium known as p.acnes, which causes the body’s defence systems to respond. - You would however not get p.acnes colonisation of the hair follicle duct without a plug forming. - The plug forms due to an increase in skin cell turnover, increased keratin deposition narrowing the opening of the hair follicle duct, combined with increased sebum production, which mixes with the debris to cause a blockage and a plug to form. - The increased sebum, keratin and cell turnover would not happen if linoleic acid levels in the skin had reduced dramatically. - Linoleic acid levels reduced due to the development of sensitivity to the hormone DHT. - DHT is formed from testosterone. The chemical reaction naturally happens throughout the body and the conversion of testosterone to DHT is assisted and promoted by the enzyme called 5-alpha reductase. (All chemical reactions in the body are controlled and accelerated by enzymes). <b>Possible solutions to the underlying causes of acne</b> 1)\tStop hormonal fluctuations. This is impossible although people do try by taking plant hormones, HRT and royal jelly. But basically it is best not to mess with our natural hormonal balance. 2)\tUse Roaccutane. This will affect the conversion of testosterone to DHT, but this will occur all over the body and DHT plays a role in a number of body functions and suppressing it leads to a number of possible side effects. 3)\tReduce DHT levels in the hair follicle and in sebaceous gland area only, known as the pilo-sebaceous unit. If it were possible to prevent testosterone from converting to DHT in the acne area of the skin but not stopping this conversion elsewhere in the body could reduce skin sensitisation and the resulting linoleic acid loss, but without affecting the conversion of testosterone to DHT in other parts of the body. This would be great in principle if one can alter the conditions in the pilosebaceous unit for an extended period of time so that DHT levels were reduced locally during the times in our lives when normal hormone levels were ‘out of sync’ with a topical preparation could lead to a reduction in the triggering of the acne process. Two products called tri-ethyl citrate and ethyl linoleate which are safe and release citric acid and linoleic acid can change conditions in the skin which slows down the enzyme 5-alpha reductase and hence testosterone conversion to DHT is slowed down locally. The testosterone conversion to DHT will still occur but just somewhere else in the body, meaning other bodily processes are not affected. 4)\t If one could also replenish linoleic acid levels in the skin then this would lead to a slow down in oil production and skin cell turnover rates and keratin deposition, preventing the plug forming and the colonisation by p.acnes. 5)\tOne could take linoleic acid supplements and foods high in linoleic acid. However linoleic acid is used by many parts of the body and one would have to take possibly toxic levels to affect skin levels significantly enough through oral supplementation alone. Doing this without going to excess is probably however a good thing and it has been noticed that the Eskimos (the Inuit) did not suffer from acne until they were introduced to western diets. However if one can find a way to supplement skin linoleic acid levels using a topical preparation then this would also have an impact on the acne process. 6)\tGetting linoleic acid into the skin is not easy but you can use special delivery technology using special molecular structures in creams such as Oleosomes and involving techniques with fancy names such as Drysyst technology to help this process. Also if one uses ethyl linoleate, then skin bacteria will help break this down and release linoleic acid into the skin (look for products containing ethyl linoleate.) 7)\tOne could normalise cell turnover to reduce skin thickening and also reduce keratin increases in skin cells. This would help to prevent blocking of the pilo-sebaceous duct. Retinol A based creams have been shown to normalise skin cell turnover rates. However a potential side effect of retinol products is increased sensitivity to UV and maybe increased skin cancer risk. So users of retinol based products are advised strongly to use a high SPF sunscreen while using retinol based products. There is a chemical called triethyl citrate which also normalises keratin deposition and skin cell turnover rates and without causing photo-sensitivity (please search for products containing triethyl citrate). 8)\tReduce oil levels on the skin. This is normally done by using detergents to keep surface oil levels down. Doing this on its own just leads to more oil production and one gets into a downward spiral with a ‘negative feedback loop’ leading to further increase (up regulation) of sebum (oil) production. However oil control is important and using mild detergents can help in controlling the acne process. Using a combination of triethyl citrate and ethyl linoleate has been shown in a clinical trial published in the British Journal of Dermatology at the end of 2007 which showed sebum production rates reduced by up to 68% with an average of 55%. 9)\tUse exfoliants and detergents to help unblock ducts by dissolving and removing plugs and keeping skin debris levels down and also reducing skin thickening. This is effective and can help but if the skin is inflamed and sore then exfoliants can, make the skin more sensitive and sore. It maybe better to use chemical exfoliants rather than irritating physical skin exfoliants. Better still use those which have shown to affect sebum production rates such as Salicylic acid and Pyruvic acid which are both hydroxy acids (also known as fruit acids). These are the only two who have shown a sebo-static effect which means temporarily slowing oil production. Another common chemical exfoliant used is glycolic acid but this has not shown to have a sebo-static effect. Also salicylic acid has shown to help with skin thickening by loosening skin cells. See products containing Salicylic acid and Pyruvic acid). 10)\tEven products with fruit acids may irritate some skins, and some acne sufferers such as younger skins can be very sensitive and actually don’t have excessive skin thickening. One could use a gentle non irritating cleansing agent containing products such as silicone and glucose based cleansers which are very skin friendly, and also contain triethyl citrate which will normalise skin thickening by addressing over active skin cell turnover, thereby addressing skin thickening from within the skin. 11)\tControl p.acnes levels. Keeping hair follicle ducts open and oxygen rich is one way but blockages can still happen. So if you are going to control p.acnes than ideally do this without attacking skin staphylococci as discussed earlier due to MRSA development risks. One can use antibiotics to do this and they may be indicated in pustular scarring acne but for most we know that p.acnes releases enzymes to break down the plug to release nutritious fatty acids which also can cause an inflammatory response from the body. If you change conditions in the pilosebaceous unit so these enzymes don’t work as well you can slow down this process and reduce the amount of food and consequently reduce the growth of p.acnes without attacking good skin bacteria (staphs) (see an example of how this ca be achieved) 12)\tReduce inflammation. Using products to control bacteria will reduce inflammation but also anti-inflammatory’s used to reduce inflammation. Stopping the release of the inflammatory fatty acids is another way, but also mopping up the inflammatory free radicals produced is an additional way of controlling inflammation. Antioxidants are useful in this regard and the best antioxidants are probably skin soluble version of vitamin C such as ascorbic acid and others such as Ascorbyl Palmitate and especially Ascorbyl tetra-isopalmitate (see an example of a product containing these). <b>In summary</b> If you have a product range which alters conditions to slow DHT production locally, increase linoleic acid levels in the skin, that normalise skin cell turnover, keratin deposits and sebum production while also having mild sebo static chemical exfoliants or silicone and glucose based cleansers. If this product also had, staph friendly antibacterials to control p.acnes, feeding and development combined with antioxidants to help control the inflammatory process, then you would have a highly effective product range which could be obtained with or without prescription and is supported by eminent dermatologists across the world, including the top dermatologist on acne in the UK who has had his independent trail published din the most respected dermatology journal in the world, then you would be onto a winner. If this product was incredibly reasonably priced you would think it would dominate the treatment options of acne.

There are numerous treatments available, including benzoyle peroxide and salicylic acid-based medications. ","keywords":" skin infections, bacterial infections, social anxiety ","article_body":" The skin is often looked at by people as an outward sign of a person's hygiene and health. Subconsciously, human beings tend to associate smooth, clear skin with being in good physical condition. Good skin is also perceived as one of the most obvious signs of physical beauty. The preoccupation with skin care has led to a boom in the skin care product industry. These skin care products are marketed to cater to the large market that demands a variety of preparations to treat dry skin, control oily skin, and even to “reverse” the aging process.  Today, manufacturers of beauty products have expanded their beauty line to include concoctions to cure skin infections. The products that are usually bought to control skin infections usually include those that are supposed to treat adult acne (acne rosacea) and teenage acne (acne vulgaris).   Adult acne and teenage acne are two entirely different things, though most scientists believe the root causes are essentially the same. There are currently no concrete findings on what the ultimate cause of acne is, though most studies point to bacteria being the most prevalent factor in both rosacea and vulgaris problems. The single, definitive cause has yet to be found but the countless studies have shown the medical world that there are a number of possible solutions to both acne rosacea and acne vulgaris. These treatments promise to help alleviate the problem of acne, as well as alleviate the social anxiety that people with severe cases of acne experience. Skin infections like acne rosacea and teenage acne are typically caused by bacterial infections in the skin. Among the many core ingredients of the medications used to treat acne and similar bacterial infections is benzoyl peroxide. In the case of acne, benzoyl peroxide works by attacking the bacteria, effectively attempting to cut off the acne at the source. However, benzoyl peroxide is a potent compound and people with sensitive skin can develop redness, rashes, and other side effects that can add to one's social anxiety, rather than help relieve it. Medically speaking, adults often find it harder to tolerate benzoyl peroxide, as compared to teenagers. An alternative for acne medication (and the subsequent relief from social anxiety) can come in the form of treatments that make use of salicylic acid. Salicylic acid works on acne in a different manner from benzoyl peroxide. While the peroxide compound works by targeting the bacterial infections behind acne, salicylic acid functions as an exfoliant. The acid works by peeling away layers of the skin, subsequently also peeling away the acne gradually. The acid is considered to be milder than the peroxide, though it can still have side effects. Additionally, salicylic acid is not as effective an acne treatment option as benzoyl peroxide, simply because it lacks the raw chemical potency of the peroxide. There are some dermatologists that suggest combination treatments as a way to relieve acne. The approach works by having people apply salicylic acid during the day time, as it is the compound that has a lower chance of inducing side effects. The benzoyl peroxide is then applied at night, before sleeping. This reduces the chances that the side effects would interfere with the patient's daily life, as well as reduce the chances of the peroxide bleaching clothing. In your typical pharmacy, there are various treatments for acne and other skin infections, and not all of them will contain salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. That doesn't mean that they don't work as well, it's just that they probably work differently from the aforementioned types of treatments. Whether one decides to take an over-the-counter treatment or go for a prescription, the important thing to remember is that once the acne has been effectively removed, then working on relieving the social anxiety can begin.

When all is said and done, if you really do want to resolve an acne condition, you are going to want to take a truly comprehensive care and treatment approach. For example, you will want to incorporate the use of tried and tested products such as ZENMED™ Derma Cleanse® System and ZENMED™ Body Acne Combo into your acne care and treatment practice. When all is said and done, the best type of acne treatment program essentially is a three part regimen that includes -- cleansing -- exfoliating -- application of treatment product Cleansing The first step in effectively treating an acne condition is properly cleansing the effected areas with an appropriate cleansing agent. (Again, if you elect to use a product line such as ZENMED™ Derma Cleanse® System and ZENMED™ Body Acne Combo, you will have available to you a proven type of cleansing agent that can get you well on your way to successfully treating your acne condition.) In addition to choosing a proper cleansing product as part of your acne treatment regimen, you also need to keep in mind that the cleansing component of an acne treatment program depends upon regularity. In other words, in most cases, you need to fully cleanse the effected areas of the skin at least two times a day. A failure to cleanse the effective areas of skin with such regularity will end up defeating the effectiveness of the treatment regimen itself. In the treatment of an acne condition, cleansing is the foundation upon which the remainder of the treatment process is built. Therefore, you will want to make certain that you develop a cleansing routine that incorporates appropriate cleansers utilized on a regular basis. In the absence of such a foundational routine, the remaining elements of a comprehensive regimen will be less than effective. Exfoliating Many people overlook the necessity of exfoliating when it comes to exercising and implementing an acne care and treatment program Exfoliating the skin is an extremely important component of an overall acne care and treatment regimen. The process of exfoliating the skin works to effectively remove dead skins cells and imbedded oils that if left unattended can cause an aggravation of an acne condition. There are some excellent products that a person can utilize to ensure that the exfoliating process properly is completed. A person should exfoliate on a daily basis. In some instances a person can go two days between exfoliations -- but, you need to keep in mind that oils, dirt and dead skin cells build up on a daily basis. Treatment Products Only very rarely can an acne condition effectively be resolved without the intervention of appropriate treatment products like those included in the ZENMED™ Derma Cleanse® System and ZENMED™ Body Acne Combo product lines. As has been referenced earlier, the treatment of acne really is a three part process cleansing, exfoliating and treatment application. There are different types of treatment products on the market today -- each of these products designed to treat different types of acne conditions. As a result, you need to take the time to consider which treatment product will best address the particular type of acne condition that your are afflicted with at a given point in time. For example, if you have a condition of body acne, you will want to invest in a comprehensive treatment program such as ZENMED™ Body Acne Combo. On the other hand, if you are suffering from facial acne -- either as an adult or a teenager -- you will want to focus on a product like ZENMED™ Derma Cleanse® System. Conclusion By adopting a comprehensive course of treatment for an acne condition you will work to resolve a current condition and you will be in a far better position to prevent future outbreaks. Additionally, even if you face a future outbreak, by utilizing a comprehensive treatment program you will be able to lessen the severity of a future acne outbreak.

The emergence of high tech medical devices and instruments has changed the way medical and health-related concerns are addressed by specialists and the public in general. One of the areas of medicine that has benefited from technology is dermatology. The emergence of biotechnology, LEDs and laser has allowed scientists to develop some of the best acne treatments that man has ever seen. Arguably, technology is the best thing that has ever happened to medicine. The discovery of LEDs, lasers and fluorescent lighting has led to the development of the use of visible light in treating acne, a process better known as phototherapy. This method of treatment has been shown to reduce 64 percent of acne lesions when used twice a week. The method apparently works better when combined with red visible light. The combination has been found to reduce lesions by 76 percent after three months of daily use. Laser surgery is already used in reducing scars caused by acne and researchers are now focusing on whether the same method can be employed to prevent the actual formation of acne. Laser technology is currently being developed to burn away follicle sac and sebaceous gland and induce the formation of oxygen in the bacteria to kill them. As of 2005, these scenarios remain in the research stage and are not yet established as definite treatment methods. Another area of high technology that presents a lot of promise for treating acne is biotechnology, particularly the fields tied with genetics. Since acne is believed to be linked with heredity, whole-genome DNA sequencing has been the focus of some research efforts. The aim is to understand the body mechanisms involve in acne formation. The use of gene therapy to alter the DNA of the skin also seems to be a not too far possibility. Technology has provided us with some of the best acne treatments ever known to man. More possibilities are still waiting to be discovered and 21st century science is on the verge of making all these possibilities a reality.

Many prefer the added revitalizing power of a hand-held re-surfacing wand. Other home systems provide the micro-crystal creams, foam applicators, and a hand-held resurfacing wand. The advantage to this all-inclusive home system is that the resurfacing wand allows you to more deeply cleanse and polish pores while giving your circulation a healthy boost. The massage action of the wand actually speeds the process of cellular generation, leaving your skin feeling brand new, ranging in price from $40 to $150. Spas and salons utilize state of the art microdermabrasion systems that use a closed-loop vacuum system. Like home systems, professional microdermabrasion treatments also rely on the polishing effects that micro-crystal creams perform on the skin’s surface. Additionally, the re-surfacing device simultaneously vacuums and sweeps the debris clear, increasing tissue stimulation. Professional systems pack more power and durability due to repeated use and varied clientele needs, requiring training and cost several thousands of dollars. Treatments usually cost around $100 to $140. The cost of microdermabrasion in a medical setting is usually more expensive because of the expertise of a dermatologist or cosmetic surgeon, though RNs and other medical technicians also provide this treatment. Medical microdermabrasion treatments are often provided as a compliment to other more invasive procedures. Medical microdermabrasion systems are the most expensive, being the most specialized, costing up to $25,000.  Treatment prices range from $100 to $200, and are often offset by combining other services. So whether in the comfort of your own home, at a health spa, or under the supervision of a medical professional, microdermabrasion technology empowers you to seriously beautify your skin at a reasonable cost, without the risks involved in laser therapy, harsh chemicals, or traditional surgery.

And this is normally the situation faced by many adults who scaled through their teenage period without any visible sign of acne that plagued their mates, only to discover to discover that they have been afflicted by adult acne at a stage in they assumed they are free from acne foe ever. For these set of people, the embarrassment and confusion that results from this is better left unsaid, and the recurring question they keep asking themselves is isn't acne supposed to be an adolescent problem. Established facts however points otherwise, adult acne is more common than what people imagined. Statistics show that nearly 40% of acne medications in America are bought and used by a class we thought are free from the condition- adults. There are several reasons why acne occurs, and the most common one many associated as the primary reason- poor hygiene- is nothing but a myth. The main causative agent for almost all acne, and that includes adult acne is as a result of hormonal imbalances or blockages of pores on the skin. Though an additional reason why adult acne occurs may be due to the oil of the sebaceous glands, or faulty closing of the hair ducts on the body, especially the face. The good news however is that almost all cases of acne can be treated. This should serve as a soothing balm to most adults, who embarrassed by the onset of adult acne, use any medication they can lay their hands on at the local drug store. This has been proved in several cases to worse the situation, because most of the medications were produced solely to combat acne in young people. Thus they may not have the ability to act on adult acne. While there might be no significant difference in form and appearance between adult acne and the regular one, if you are afflicted with adult acne, a smart move will be to consult a dermatologist. This skin physician will be able to explain what caused the adult acne in the first place. Once the diagnosis has been made, the physician can then suggest a prescription drug that can eliminate the condition permanently. But in reality, any adult that is afflicted by adult acne need not be embarrassed by the problem. As stated earlier, the prevalence of adult acne is more common than imagined, so the best option still remain going to a dermatologist to eliminate the condition instead of resorting to self medication and spending a fortune in the process, nor forgetting the anxiety and fear that are sure to happen when you discover the onset signs of acne.

Many of the acne medication treatments may include topical or systematic acne solutions. Additionally, homeopathic treatments may also be applied to prevent the out-break of acne, an example of which is the use of mild soaps and water. Which acne medication to use first depends on what is the cause of acne. There can be many causes of acne. Some of the causes include • Over-secretion of the sebaceous glands of its sebum (natural oil of the skin). • Hormon imbalances due to internal changes in your body. • The weakening of the immune system due to the attacks of the acne-infecting bacteria called as \"Propionibacterium acnes\". • Impaired internal detoxification system. • The reaction of the digestive system to the food items you eat. • Stress. • Genetic influences. • Environmental pollutants or toxins. • Cosmetics that contain chemicals, preservatives or harmful substances. The severity of your acne problem determines the type of acne medication to be used. In fact, for the less serious acne cases or conditions, it is best to start with natural acne solutions. This normally comprises of natural herbs and exotic plants that are effective in removing blemishes and the prevention of bacterial formation. One example of less serious acne symptoms are those that appear on the onset of an acne outbreak. Fruits and vegetables are perfect in lessening the effects of the above mentioned factors. They contain eeded minerals and vitamins for healthy skin. These may also have the properties of effectively cleansing and removing the oil from the skin tissues, like that of cucumbers and tomatoes. Most vegetables and fruits have a high water content. Water itself is potent in releasing body toxins from the body. Increasing your intake of fruits and vegetables and drinking plenty of distilled water can help prevent the onset of acne. However, if you have a serious acne breakout, the use of acne medication treatment may be suitable. Acne medication products include topical and systematic acne solutions. Topical acne solutions are those which you apply on the skin surface. One ingredient found in a topical acne medication product is benzoyl peroxide. Benzoyl peroxide is effective in reducing the quantity of bacteria on the skin. However, prolonged use can result in dryness of the skin, contract dermatitis and cause skin irritations. Another ingredient in a topical acne medication product is Azeilic acid. Azeilic acid is known for its diminishing effect like that of benzoyl peroxide, on the bacterial presence on the skin. This acne solution is also effective in evening out the darker complexions produced by the recent flare-ups of acne. The side effects of this acne solution are impermanent discoloration on the affected area and extreme dryness. In addition, Erythromycin in its topical form may reduce the acne inflammation. This acne solution is often combined with benzoyl peroxide to rigorously attack belligerent infection caused by the \"Propionibacterium acnes\". An acne solution that does not only obstruct the growth of the acne-infecting bacteria but may also address inflammation and clogged pores is Sodium Sulfacetamide treatment. However, it is not commonly used as a treatment to acne because of its smell. Yet, it has been proven to help acne flare-ups in many cases. Systematic acne medications are usually prescribed to more severe cases of acne infections. Generally speaking, the treatment may last up to six months. For women, the most prescribed systematic acne solution is anti-androgens. This form of treatment controls the secretion of a certain hormone and is commonly referred to as hormonal treatment. Treating your skin with the right acne medication type is important. For instance, if your acne problem is at best mild, you don't want to be applying too strong a product on your skin. Too harsh a product can cause your skin to age faster and result in wrinkles or dry scaly skin. It is therefore, best to research properly on acne medications that will be the most appropriate for your acne problem.

The nature of the event isn't important; it may be a first date, an important job interview, or your own birthday party. You try to hide behind hair or heavy make-up. But you can't ignore the face in the mirror. Sound familiar? For acne sufferers all over the world, these scenarios are all too common. Even routine social interactions — a day at the office, a trip to the market — can be a nightmare of stress and self-loathing. Yet, due to the \"merely cosmetic\" nature of acne vulgaris, these very real emotions are widely dismissed as oversensitivity. Clear-faced friends and co-workers say, \"Really, it looks worse to you.\" And they're probably right. But they're missing an important point Acne is as much about how you feel as how you look. Over the years, the research methods and medical treatments may have changed, but the answers to the question \"how does your acne make you feel?\" have remained alarmingly constant Ugly. Angry. Dirty. Depressed. These answers are consistent across gender lines, age barriers and national borders. What is being done? Every year, millions of dollars are devoted to the medical study and treatment of acne; millions more are spent on the development and marketing of over-the-counter remedies. Comparatively little energy, however, has been spent determining the psychological and social effects of the condition. Consider the following statement There is no single condition which causes more psychic trauma, more maladjustment between parent and children, more general insecurity and feelings of inferiority and greater sums of psychic suffering than does acne vulgaris.1 Made by Sulzberger and Zaidems in a 1948 article, this statement rings true today. Despite acne's limited impact on overall patient health, several studies have concluded that it produces a similar degree of emotional stress to skin conditions causing significant physical disability. The implications are fairly obvious Acne hurts more on the inside. So why is it so easy for people to dismiss these feelings as vanity? The problem of measuring emotion. The difficulty lies not in validating acne's negative affects, but in quantifying them. For years, researchers have been struggling to find an accurate means of measurement for this particular kind of study. Scientists use psychometrics to measure conditions of the mind, but have yet to develop a scale for evaluating the psychological effects of physical conditions such as acne. And the use of psychometric scales for evaluating acne patients has been largely inconclusive. Why? Emotional symptoms — depression, anger, low self-esteem — are influenced by an incredible number of variables. So it's difficult to know for sure whether one's depression is caused by acne alone or a combination of factors, ranging from trouble in school to on-the-job stress. At the moment, the best way to understand the psychosocial effects of acne seems surprisingly simple Listen. The power of patient testimony. Until science develops an accurate scale, the best way for us to learn about acne's emotional effects is from the patients themselves. The following passages are excerpted from verbatim quotes taken during a 1995 study in San Francisco.2 In dramatic contrast with the psychometric questionnaires used in the past, patients were asked open-ended questions and encouraged to answer at length. It has been many years since I have looked in a mirror. I comb my hair using a silhouette on the wall to show the outline of my head. I have not looked myself in the eyes in years, and that is painful to not be able to do that, and that is a direct result of acne. When my acne got more severe, I began to really examine more things, become more aware of social norms, what is acceptable, what is attractive. That is when I began to have lower self-esteem; it made me become more of an introvert. It made me want to avoid certain occasions. 'Ask her out? Well, maybe not. She won't be interested because of how I look. It's associated with being dirty, and I hate that, because it's not at all like that. I inherited it from my mother, and she is always telling me that she had the exact same thing, and that it will go away. I am mad that I inherited it from her. My dad makes me feel bad because he never had bad skin when he was younger, so he doesn't understand. My mother doesn’t know what she has done to hurt me. If I ate fatty foods, she would criticize. If I ate spicy food — which Thai food is, they are all spicy — she would say that because I ate spicy food, that was why I had pimples. She kept telling me how ugly my face was, and no one was going to marry me if I had bad-looking skin. And that really hurts me. I know I am so insecure in this way — but if I go into a store, I won't buy candy, even if I really want it. I think in my mind that people are looking at what I am buying, and thinking, 'Oh, she eats junk. No wonder she has so many zits on her face. From just this small sample, it's easy to see the wide-ranging emotional impact of acne on those who suffer from it. These accounts of family conflict, social withdrawal and deep private suffering are, according to the patients, the direct result of their acne. While it's hard to measure the impact of this condition, the message within these testimonies is clear Acne can cause profound emotional suffering. Of course, if you live with acne, this isn’t news — but it may be helpful to know you’re not alone.

","keywords":" acne, acne solutions, skin care, acne treatment, beauty tips, Proactive, Proactive solution, Proactiv ","article_body":" Unless you are in that small percentage that never had any acne problems, you know that acne is a drag. It is unsightly and often painful, resulting in lower self-esteem and confidence for the acne sufferer. While many people would agree that getting acne on their backs is not as bad as getting it directly on their face, it is still an uncomfortable and unpleasant trial to go through. Although acne on the back is easier to cover with clothes, it is not always possible to be completely covered, such as when you want to go to the swimming pool or the beach and must wear a bathing suit. Back acne, or “bacne”, can make even the most physically fit person in the world very conscientious about themselves and their condition. Bacne is caused by the same principles that form acne on other parts of the body. The back contains that secrete a fluid known as sebum. If too much of this oil is produced by the body and left on the skin for too long, a person’s hair follicles and pores will become blocked up, thus exposing the area to bacteria that clogs and inflame the skin tissues. Back and chest acne are more commonly found in males. Often on the back area blemishes will run more deeply, making them painful and more difficult to treat. One of the most important aspects of acne prevention is to keep the back clean at all times or as much as possible. Regular bathing is essential. While bathing, be sure to scrub the back until it is well exfoliated. Be careful not to scrub too hard, as this may irritate and dry out the skin, leading to more outbreaks. You may be better off getting a gently exfoliating product, such as <a href= http//www.crescatsententia.org>ProActive solution</a> when washing to prevent over exfoliation. The back must remain as dry as possible and not be exposed to excessive perspiration. If you participate in strenuous activities, you will want to remove a sweat soaked shirt after you are done. There is also the factor of what clothes you wear in regard to back acne outbreaks. Tight clothing or carrying heavy materials such as backpacks will chafe and irritate the pores and lead to flare-ups by rubbing across the hair follicles. It is advisable to alternate tight fitting clothes with loose fitting ones occasionally and to try alternating backpacks with side packs or handle bags. For milder cases of back acne there are over the counter treatments and other skin care solutions that contain benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. There are also a variety of on-line ordered products that are very effective, such as <a href=http//www.crescatsententia.org>ProActive solution</a>. Remember, pregnant women should avoid products that contain salicylic acid, as it can possibly lead to complications during pregnancy or even birth defects. These are to be applied normally after washing, just like with facial acne solutions. For more advanced cases of back acne, a physician or dermatologist may need to be consulted to get the desired effects. This is when smaller blemishes develop into pustules or cysts. If the back acne is reoccurring, a dermatologist may prescribe some oral antibiotics such as tetracycline or minocycline. If deep blemishes or cysts are left untreated, they may develop into scars that are visible on the back. For a natural way to prevent back acne, try using a mixture of lye, soap, and tea tree oil. All three ingredients contain antiseptic, anti-bacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties that will not only help clear up and prevent other outbreaks, but can also restore the skin’s suppleness. There are also a number of creams and soaps that contain natural ingredients such as tea tree oil, neem, and basil that are effective in maintaining and restoring the skin’s natural appearance. Whatever treatment you choose, remember, back acne can be overcome. If you find that one solution does not give the desired effects, there are always other alternatives. Taking the time to prevent back acne is a good idea for your health and self-confidence, so don’t get discouraged and keep trying.

If you answered acne, then you hit this hard-to-treat condition on the head.  While a more difficult question might have been how to treat acne, dermatologists are at the forefront of using laser technology to stop acne in its tracks – and prevent the acne scars that are often a result. No. 1 Skin Condition Acne is the most commonly diagnosed skin disorder in the world, topping the list of reasons that patients seek out the help of a dermatologist.  While studies show that acne is not caused by diet or stress but by physiological factors such as hormones, excess oil and bacteria, patients often place the blame on their own shoulders. “Acne patients are often times truly frustrated, and rightfully so,” said by a dermatologist.  “They hear mixed messages about the causes of acne and sometimes spend an enormous amount of time and money trying to treat the condition with the latest over-the-counter products.  By the time I see them in my office, the acne usually has worsened to the point that it is affecting their self-esteem and social lives.  But it’s important to remember that acne is a treatable medical condition.” Acne lesions are prevalent on parts of the body where there is a high concentration of pores that contain oil-producing sebaceous follicles, such as the face, neck, chest, shoulders, and upper back.  When these follicles become clogged and inflamed, blackheads and whiteheads develop.  If a whitehead or blackhead ruptures, its infected contents come into contact with the skin and the infection spreads - producing what is classically referred to as a zit.  In a worst-case scenario, the zit becomes so badly infected it turns into a cyst that is located deep in the skin.  If left untreated, these painful lesions can lead to an acne scar. Until recently, a combination of topical and oral medications - including antibiotics - has been used almost exclusively with varying degrees of success to combat acne.  Now, dermatologists are using non-ablative laser technology to successfully treat active acne and the scarring that often results as well. One of the main benefits of non-ablative lasers, in contrast to their ablative counterparts, is that they can clear acne without producing a notable injury to the outer layer of the skin.  Non-ablative therapy works by targeting the overactive sebaceous glands that are responsible for acne.  The laser emits a wavelength of light that is strongly absorbed by water within the skin.  This generates heat in and around the sebaceous glands.  By creating a mild thermal injury just below the skin’s surface, a non-ablative laser alters the structure and function of the sebaceous gland, leading to prolonged acne clearance. \"I believe that laser-based applications for acne will one day become the preferred treatment option for acne patients, many of which are dissatisfied with topical and systemic treatments and are wary of their risks and side effects,\" explained by the dermatologist. \"I use non-ablative therapy extensively in my practice, and I've found it to be a safe and cost-effective treatment that has dramatically changed my patients' lives for the better.\" Non-ablative treatments typically take between five to 20 minutes, during which time the patient experiences a slight snapping or stinging sensation that is alleviated with a pre-treatment topical anesthetic and post-treatment ice application.  A series of three to five treatments are delivered at monthly intervals in order to achieve the desired clearance. Marked reduction in acne lesions often occurs within a couple of treatment sessions, and a series of treatments should result in acne clearance for more than six months.  Side effects are limited to mild redness and swelling, which will not interfere with a person’s daily activities. Acne’s Cruel Reminders Non-ablative laser therapy is also being used to successfully treat the scars that remain long after the initial acne has been cleared.  While acne scars rarely pose a health risk, they are difficult to treat and can be very damaging to a person’s self-esteem. Traditionally, dermatologists have used dermabrasion, surgical excision, and fillers, such as collagen, to diminish scarring.  However, the results in many cases were limited. Over the last several years, laser technology has assumed an increasingly important role in the treatment of acne scars.  At first, ablative lasers were used to sculpt or vaporize the skin's surface.  Now, techniques involving non-ablative lasers have taken over, thanks primarily to their ability to promote collagen growth beneath an acne scar without creating an external injury. \"Our experience has shown that patients treated with this therapy experience significant improvement in the appearance of their acne scars,” said by a dermatologist.  “After a series of three monthly non-ablative treatments, patients have many times exceeded our expectations and often outperformed the results obtained by ablative lasers.\" With medical technology advancing at a rapid rate, Dr. Alster cautioned patients to be sure to consult a dermatologist experienced in laser therapy for proper treatment. \"Don’t be afraid to ask your physician questions about his or her experience and qualifications or training with a particular procedure,” said Dr. Alster.  “Since any type of laser procedure can carry potential side effects, it’s important to entrust your care to qualified hands.\" "},{"title":" The Impact of Acne ","word_count":618,"summary":" This article talks about the impact of acne to the people who have it.

Why? Because acne sufferers are plagued with feelings of depression, embarrassment and have a poor body image. This then leads to frustration, anger and severe depression. These negative psychological effects can have a very crippling impact on an individual's social life, which in turn will discourage them from pursuing life’s opportunities socially, scholastically and even in the work force. Depression caused by acne can lead to low self esteem, causing sufferers to purposely miss dates, social gatherings, classes, job interviews and even work. Psychological Impact Although acne is not considered to be a life threatening disorder, its psychological effects can be quite profound as acne affects the most visible parts of your body. The psychological effects of acne have only come to light in recent years. Fact The psychological scarring caused by acne can last forever, so it is a very important topic to explore. Note that the severity of acne can also be measured by its effect on an acne sufferer's emotional and social life. How to Help Now that we’ve established that acne blemishes, cysts, etc. can be very damaging to the psyche, especially during the teenage years, which is when the formation of an individual undergoes so many important changes, what can be done to prevent this. After all, we are talking about some serious dismantling conditions that may lead to depressive disorders, academic decline, social isolation, substance abuse and even suicide. What to do? The first step an Acne sufferer must take is to come to terms with his or her condition. It will have a negative impact on your life because our society judges us by our appearance. The trick is that an acne sufferer does not need to face this alone. Think about the numbers mentioned in the home page “Acne affects about 80% of all adolescents”. That means that eight out of every ten people around you is or has had to battle with acne and its negative social impacts. So don’t be shy to inform and involve people you come into contact with to prevent the psychological scarring from becoming permanent. Your entire family, teachers, coaches and doctors all must have a better understanding of the effects acne is having on you. This may seem like an awkward and difficult task, but you will be surprised by how understanding and compassionate others will be towards your situation. If you feel too shy to bring it up in conversation, then print up this page and leave it on your teacher’s or coach’s desk and/or have your friends and family read it. Send them the link to this page. This will instigate both understanding, support and open communication on something that should not be kept secret.

Be sure that they understand that it is not due to poor dietary habits, poor personal hygiene, or anything else which may lead to the idea that it is your fault that you have acne. People need to know that acne is not your fault. A supportive family, supportive friends and even a supportive coach or teacher will help you to no end in maintaining your self esteem.

","keywords":" acne, acne treatments, acne cures, acne problems, acne scars, treating acne scars ","article_body":" Medically speaking, an acne sufferer has a combination of elements working in unison, often causing inflammation to our skin – otherwise known as acne. These elements include • Trapped bacteria under the skin • Increased oil • Keratosis retention Increased oil within the skin can be caused by make-up, but is usually produced by the sebaceous glands. Sometimes these glands produce an increased amount of oil, resulting in acne and pimples. Retention of Keratosis can also cause excess oil and this happens when skin cells (that are not shed) block the sebaceous ducts. The role of the sebaceous ducts is to get rid of excess oil. Commonly, outbreaks of acne occur during teenage years, but can occur with some people at any age. Acne is more common in teenagers, because of the marked increase in hormone activity processes within the skin. Whether it is a teen affected by acne, or an adult, it is a fact that hormones play major role in producing acne. Male hormones are more likely to increase oil production than female hormones are. Although male hormones have a greater effect, some male and female hormones are very similar. Therefore, when hormones are released by women during a menstrual cycle, hormones like the male hormones cause increased oil gland activity. As a result, some women who are menstruating run a higher risk of getting pimples, spots, or acne during their menstrual cycle. Although acne affects many people, certain acne treatments and acne cures have been proven to be very effective. And certain myths, such as sun-bathing helps to clear up acne, have been medically proven to be untrue.

"},{"title":" The Many Causes Of Acne ","word_count":464,"summary":" Heredity, skin oils, hair follicles, and hormones are the prime suspects in this ongoing mystery. Learn the biology of acne and you can avoid the most common mistakes that aggravate acne. ","keywords":" acne, acne medication ","article_body":" Acne remains a bit of a mystery. It seems to be partly hereditary, but why some people are affected by it and others are untouched isn't exactly known. We do, however, understand some of the biology behind it. The main culprit is the excess production of sebum, an oily substance whose function is to keep skin and hair lubricated and supple. The production of the oily sebum blocks the skin's surface, which provides an ideal environment for bacterial growth. The bacteria multiply, the skin area becomes red and inflamed, and then a pimple pops up. The Role Of Testosterone The excess production of sebum is caused by testosterone, the male hormone. However, testosterone is present in both males and females. During puberty, the body changes in its reaction to testosterone, thereby producing extra sebum. This irregular reaction, occurring mainly during adolescence, causes the skin -- particularly the face and upper torso -- to become oily. The sebum then combines with naturally occurring dead skin cells to block hair follicles. The body usually regulates its reaction to testosterone by the early 20s, and then the annoying acne clears up. Hair Follicle Theory Narrowing hair follicles could be involved with the production of acne -- so says a recent scientific theory. Evidence suggests that hair follicles may become restricted for several reasons, including excessive shedding of cells within the follicle, abnormal cell binding, or water retention which causes the skin to swell. The narrowed hair follicles prevent dead cells from being expelled from the body, creating a buildup beneath the skin. Combined with sebum, it produces ideal conditions for acne. Making Matters Worse Many people can't resist squeezing their pimples. This may make the condition worse, by spreading the bacteria to the surrounding skin area. It also can lead to scarring, sometimes permanently. Even touching the face can worsen acne. Without realizing it, most of us touch our faces many times throughout the day. The problem is that our hands contain oils and bacteria that will increase the acne symptoms. In fact, all objects, including eyeglasses and telephone handsets, that make contact with the face must be clean. Hair, particularly long hair, also touches your face, so it is important to keep your hair clean and oil free. Fabric accessories such as hats and headbands should be avoided or used as little as possible. Other Factors Other things that seem to aggravate acne conditions include diet, skin irritation, stress, hormonal activities such as menstrual cycles, and certain medications. Dietary links show skim milk products to be related to acne. There is no statistical evidence, however, that foods such as chocolate and fast food have any association with pimples or aggravates acne. Medications associated with acne include anabolic steroids (used for bodybuilding), lithium, barbiturates, halogens, and androgens.

This section addresses some of the common questions asked by people with acne. Please remember that your dermatologist is always the best source of specific information about your individual health issues, including acne. Questions and Answer does follows 1. What causes acne? The causes of acne are linked to the changes that take place as young people mature from childhood to adolescence (puberty). The hormones that cause physical maturation also cause the sebaceous (oil) glands of the skin to produce more sebum (oil). The hormones with the greatest effect on sebaceous glands are androgens (male hormones), which are present in females as well as males, but in higher amounts in males. Sebaceous glands are found together with a hair shaft in a unit called a sebaceous follicle. During puberty, the cells of the skin that line the follicle begin to shed more rapidly. In people who develop acne, cells shed and stick together more so than in people who do not develop acne. When cells mix with the increased amount of sebum being produced, they can plug the opening of the follicle. Meanwhile, the sebaceous glands continue to produce sebum, and the follicle swells up with sebum. In addition, a normal skin bacteria called P. acnes, begins to multiply rapidly in the clogged hair follicle. In the process, these bacteria produce irritating substances that can cause inflammation. Sometimes, the wall of the follicle bursts, spreading inflammation to the surrounding skin. This is the process by which acne lesions, from blackheads to pimples to nodules, are formed. 2. I wash my face several times a day. Why do I still get acne? Many people still believe that acne is caused by dirty skin. The truth is, washing alone will not clear up or prevent acne. Washing does, however, help remove excess surface oils and dead skin cells. Many people use all kinds of products, including alcohol-based cleansers, and scrub vigorously, only to irritate the skin further and worsen their acne. Washing the skin twice a day gently with water and a mild soap is usually all that is required. However, acne is actually caused by a variety of biologic factors that are beyond the control of washing. For that reason, you should use appropriate acne treatments for the acne. 3. Does stress cause acne? Stress is commonly blamed for the development of acne. Stress can have many physiologic effects on the body, including changes in hormones that may theoretically lead to acne. In some cases the stress may actually be caused by the acne lesions, not the other way around! If the acne is being treated effectively, stress is not likely to have much impact on the majority of people. 4. I never had acne as a teenager. Why am I now getting acne as an adult? Usually, acne begins at puberty and is gone by the early 20s. In some cases, acne may persist into adulthood. Such types of acne include severe forms that affect the body as well as the face (which afflict males more than females) and acne associated with the menstrual cycle in women. In other cases, acne may not present itself until adulthood. Such acne is more likely to affect females than males. There are several reasons for this. As females get older, the pattern of changes in hormones may itself change, disposing sebaceous glands to develop acne. Ovarian cysts and pregnancy may also cause hormonal changes that lead to acne. Some women get acne when they discontinue birth control pills that have been keeping acne at bay. Sometimes young women may wear cosmetics that are comedogenic-that is, they can set up conditions that cause comedones to form. 5. What role does diet play in acne? Acne is not caused by food. Following a strict diet will not, clear your skin. While some people feel that their acne is aggravated by certain foods, particularly chocolate, colas, peanuts, shellfish and some fatty foods, there is no scientific evidence that suggests food causes or influences acne. Avoid any foods which seem to worsen your acne and, for your overall health, eat a balanced diet--but diet shouldn't really matter if the acne is being appropriately treated. 6. Does the sun help acne? Many patients feel that sunlight improves their acne lesions and go to great lengths to find sources of ultraviolet light. There is no proven effect of sunlight on acne. In addition, ultraviolet light in sunlight increases the risk of skin cancer and early aging of the skin. It is, therefore, not a recommended technique of acne management, especially since there are many other proven forms of treatment for acne. Moreover, many acne treatments increase the skin's sensitivity to ultraviolet light, making the risk of ultraviolet light exposure all the worse. 7. What is the best way to treat acne? Everyone's acne must be treated individually. If you have not gotten good results from the acne products you have tried, consider seeing a dermatologist. Your dermatologist will decide which treatments are best for you. For more information about the types of acne treatments that are available, and for basic acne treatment guidelines, please see Acne Treatments in the main part of AcneNet. 8. What kind of cosmetics and cleansers can an acne patient use? Look for \"noncomedogenic\" cosmetics and toiletries. These products have been formulated so that they will not cause acne. Some acne medications cause irritation or pronounced dryness particularly during the early weeks of therapy, and some cosmetics and cleansers can actually worsen this effect. The choice of cosmetics and cleansers should be made with your dermatologist or pharmacist. Heavy foundation makeup should be avoided. Most acne patients should select powder blushes and eye shadow over cream products because they are less irritating and noncomedogenic. Camouflaging techniques can be used effectively by applying a green undercover cosmetic over red acne lesions to promote color blending. 9. Is it harmful to squeeze my blemishes? Yes. In general, acne lesions should not be picked or squeezed by the patient. In particular, inflammatory acne lesions should never be squeezed. Squeezing forces infected material deeper into the skin, causing additional inflammation and possible scarring. 10. Can anything be done about scarring caused by acne? Scarring is best prevented by getting rid of the acne. Dermatologists can use various methods to improve the scarring caused by acne. The treatment must always be individualized for the specific patient. Chemical peels may be used in some patients, while dermabrasion or laser abrasion may benefit others. It is important that the acne be well controlled before any procedure is used to alleviate scarring. 11. How long before I see a visible result from using my acne medication? The time for improvement depends upon the product being used, but in almost all cases it is more a matter of weeks or months instead of days. Most dermatologists would recommend the use of a medication or combination of medications daily for 4 to 8 weeks before they would change the treatment. It is very important for patients to be aware of this time frame so they do not become discouraged and discontinue their medications. Conversely, if you see no change whatsoever, you might want to check with your dermatologist regarding the need to change treatments. 12. Would using my medication more frequently than prescribed speed up the clearing of my acne? No--always use your medication exactly as your dermatologist instructed. Using topical medications more often than prescribed may actually induce more irritation of the skin, redness and follicular plugging, which can delay clearing time. If oral medications are taken more frequently than prescribed, they won't work any better, but there is a greater chance of side effects. 13. My topical treatment seems to work on the spots I treat, but I keep getting new acne blemishes. What should I do? Topical acne medications are made to be used on all acne-prone areas, not just individual lesions. Part of the goal is to treat the skin before lesions can form and to prevent formation, not just to treat existing lesions. Patients are generally advised to treat all of the areas (forehead, cheeks, chin and nose) that tend to break out rather than just individual lesions. 14. My face is clear! Can I stop taking my medication now? If your dermatologist says you can stop, then stop--but follow your dermatologist's instructions. Many times patients will stop their medication suddenly only to have their acne flare up several weeks later. If you are using multiple products, it may be advisable to discontinue one medication at a time and judge results before discontinuing them all at once. Ask your dermatologist before you stop using any of your medications. 15. Does it matter what time I use my medication? Check with your dermatologist or pharmacist. If you were taking one dose a day of an antibiotic, you could probably take it in the morning, at midday or in the evening, although you should pick one time of day and stay with it throughout your treatment. With oral medications prescribed twice a day or three times a day, you should try your best to spread out the doses evenly. Some antibiotics should be taken on an empty or nearly empty stomach. For optimal results with topical treatments, you should strictly follow your dermatologist's recommendations. For example, if instructed to apply benzoyl peroxide in the morning and a topical retinoid at bedtime, it is important to follow these directions strictly. If the two were applied together at bedtime, for example, you could decrease the efficacy of the treatment because of chemical reactions that make them less effective. 16. I have trouble remembering to take my oral medication every day. What's a good way to remember? What should I do if I forget a dose? This is a common problem. Many patients try to associate taking their medication with a routine daily event such as brushing teeth or applying makeup. It also helps to keep the medication close to the area where the reminder activity is carried out. In most cases, if you miss a day of your oral treatment, do not double up the next day; rather, get back to your daily regimen as soon as possible--but there may be different instructions for different oral medications. Ask your dermatologist or pharmacist about what to do if you miss a dose of your particular medication. 17. I have been using topical benzoyl peroxide and an oral antibiotic for my acne and have noticed blue-black and brown marks developing on my face and some discoloration on my body. The marks are especially noticeable around acne scars and recently healed lesions. Is this a side effect of medication and is it permanent? It is not possible to make general statements about side effects of medications that apply to individual cases. A dermatologist should be consulted. The facial marks and body discoloration described by the patient in this case do fall within the range of side effects of some antibiotics. Unique patterns of pigmentation are sometimes seen in acne patients treated with certain oral antibiotics—particularly minocycline. The pigmentation patterns that appear may include * Localized blue-black or brown marks in and around acne scars and in areas of previous acne inflammation * A \"muddy skin\" appearance that may cover much of the body * Diffuse brownish pigmentation of the feet and lower legs. The pigmentation side effect gradually disappears after the therapy is discontinued. Any side effect of a medication should be noted by the patient and brought to the attention of the physician. While most side effects are temporary they should be discussed with the physician and monitored. 18. My doctor is prescribing a topical retinoid for my acne. He said a retinoid is a substance related to vitamin A. If the drug is related to vitamin A, shouldn’t vitamin A dietary supplements be helpful in getting rid of acne? Dietary vitamin A is essential to good health, especially vision. It has healthful effects in the skin. Large doses of vitamin A for the treatment of acne is not recommended on grounds of safety. The retinoids and retinoid-like substances used as topical treatments for acne are prepared especially for their potent effect on the shedding of cell lining in the sebaceous follicle. Their use should be monitored by a dermatologist. Dietary vitamin A has multiple health effects in the human body. Vitamin A is essential for good vision. Extreme vitamin A deficiency can result in blindness, usually accompanied by dry, scaly skin. Vitamin A overdose that far exceeds the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of 5,000 IU can have effects nearly as catastrophic. Extreme vitamin A overdose can cause the skin to blister and peel—an effect first seen in early North Pole explorers who nearly died after eating polar bear liver that has an extraordinarily high vitamin A content. Topical retinoids are usually prescribed as a treatment for moderate to severe acne. Side effects are chiefly dermatologic, including redness, scaling and dryness of the skin, itching and burning. These side effects can usually be managed by adjustment of the amount and timing of retinoid applied to the skin. Dose adjustment must be discussed with the dermatologist who prescribed the treatment. 19. Are there any acne treatments specifically for people with dark skin? Are there any treatments specifically harmful to dark skin? There are no acne treatments specifically for use on dark skin. Acne treatments are generally as safe and effective on dark skin as on light skin. Some treatments for acne scars may cause temporary lightening of dark skin. Acne is a common skin disease that has the same causes and follows the same course in all colors of skin. Very dark or black skin may be less well-moisturized than lighter skin. Topical anti-acne agents such as benzoyl peroxide that have a drying effect on the skin should be used under the supervision of a dermatologist. Benzoyl peroxide also is a strong bleach and therefore must be applied carefully to avoid inadvertent decolorization of a patch of hair, towels or clothing. Darker skin has a tendency to develop post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (excessive skin darkening at places where the skin was inflamed). Severe inflammatory acne may result in dark spots. The spots resolve over time; a dermatologist may be able to recommend cosmetic measures to make the spots less apparent until they resolve. Some acne treatments, such as topical retinoids and azelaic acid, may also help fade the discoloration. Removal of acne scars by dermabrasion or chemical peeling may cause temporary lightening or darkening of dark skin in the areas of treatment. Scar treatment should be discussed with a dermatologist or dermatologic surgeon before it is undertaken. Alterations of melanin (dark pigments that give the skin its color) pigmentation such as vitiligo and melasma are not related to acne, but they may be present simultaneously with acne. The diagnosis and treatment of melanin pigmentation disorders such as vitiligo requires a dermatologist with knowledge and experience in treating these conditions. 20. Is acne that appears for the first time in adulthood different from acne that appears in adolescence? Acne has a specific definition as a disease of sebaceous follicles. This definition applies to acne that occurs at any age. However, it may be important to look for an underlying cause of acne that occurs for the first time in adulthood. Current understanding of the causes of acne vulgaris is described in the Main Text section Why and how acne happens. In brief summary, acne vulgaris develops when excessive sebum production and abnormal growth and death of cells in the sebaceous follicle result in plugging of follicles with a mixture of sebum and cellular debris and formation of comedones (blackheads and whiteheads). Bacteria in the follicles—chiefly Propionibacterium acnes, the most common bacterial colonist of sebaceous follicles—may contribute to the inflammation of acne by release of metabolic products that cause inflammatory reaction. The pathogenic events, which cause disease, in the sebaceous follicle are believed to be due in large degree to changes in levels of androgenic (male) hormones in the body—a circumstance usually associated with growth and development between ages 12 and 21. Some acne investigators believe that although this understanding is generally correct, there is more yet to be learned about the causes of acne vulgaris. Acne that appears after the age of 25-30 years is (1) a recurrence of acne that cleared up after adolescence, (2) a flare-up of acne after a period of relative quiet—for example, during pregnancy, or (3) acne that occurs for the first time in a person who had never previously had acne. Acne that occurs in adulthood may be difficult to treat if there are multiple recurrences. Some patients with severe recurrent acne have undergone repeated courses of treatment with the potent systemic drug isotretinoin. Acne flares in association with pregnancy or menstruation are due to changes in hormonal patterns. Acne that appears for the first time in adulthood should be investigated for any underlying cause. Drugs that can induce acne include anabolic steroids (sometimes used illegally by athletes to “bulk up”), some anti-epileptic drugs, the anti-tuberculosis drugs isoniazid and rifampin, lithium, and iodine-containing drugs. Chlorinated industrial chemicals may induce the occupational skin disorder known as chloracne. Chronic physical pressure on the skin—for example, by a backpack and its straps, or a violin tucked against the angle of the jaw and chin—may induce so-called acne mechanica. Some metabolic conditions may cause changes in hormonal balance that can induce acne. Some lesions that appear to be acne may be another skin disorder such as folliculitis—infection and inflammation of hair follicles—that require different treatment than acne. Acne that appears for the first time in adulthood should be examined and treated by a dermatologist. 22. My 15-year-old daughter has what I would describe as a very mild case of acne. She has made it much worse by constant picking and squeezing. She looks in the mirror for hours, looking for some blackhead or blemish she can pick or squeeze. Does she need psychological counseling? Excessive picking and squeezing of otherwise mild acne is a condition called excoriated acne, seen most often in young women. A dermatologist may provide effective counseling. The typical person with excoriated acne is a person—often a young women—who is so distressed with her appearance due to acne that she literally tries to \"squeeze the acne out of existence.\" The acne is often very mild, but the person’s face may constantly be covered with red marks from squeezing, and open sores where lesions have been picked open. The word excoriate means to scratch or abrade the skin. Excoriated acne is a medically recognized condition that should be discussed with a dermatologist. Occasionally giving in to a temptation to squeeze a blackhead is not defined as excoriated acne. Hours in front of a mirror, squeezing and picking every blemish, is a definition of excoriated acne. A dermatologist may be able to counsel the patient regarding a course of treatment in which the patient can participate, but keep \"hands off.\" 23. Can the rate of secretion or the composition of sebum be altered by diet? If it can, shouldn’t alteration of diet be considered a treatment for acne? Diet has never been proven to have a role in the cause or treatment of acne. Dietary manipulation may have a role in the treatment of some scaling diseases of the skin, but not in the treatment of acne. Dietary cause is one of the most persistent myths about acne. Foods, such as chocolate or greasy foods, do not cause acne, but certain foods seem to make some people’s acne worse. The following can bring on or worsen it * Hereditary factors * An increase in male hormones found in both males and females * Menstruation * Emotional stress * Oil and grease from cosmetics, work environment No food has been shown to be effective in preventing or treating acne. A healthy diet is, of course, necessary for good general health. 24. Shouldn't I just try to eliminate sebum from my body? No. When it isn't blocked in your pores, sebum helps keep your skin healthy. 25. Why does acne usually start at puberty? No one knows for certain. What is known is that the sebaceous glands that produce sebum get much larger at puberty than they were before. 26. Why does the skin around a pimple turn red? This redness is caused by the body's inflammatory response. Inflammation is a sign that your immune system is working to fight an infection. However, the inflammatory response doesn't always work perfectly, and can even be the cause of scarring. 27. If my skin turns red, does that mean that I'm going to have scars? Usually, no. Even when there will be no permanent scar, the aftereffects of the inflammatory response can leave the skin red for months, sometimes for more than a year. 28. What are free radicals? Free radicals are byproducts of oxidation in your body. We all need oxidation to occur as part of our life process, but there is concern that the buildup of unrecycled free radicals contributes to many conditions, including skin damage. Antioxidants, including several of the active ingredients in Acuzine, help prevent the buildup of free radicals. "},{"title":" The Physical Effects of Acne ","word_count":1085,"summary":" The effects of acne — both physical and emotional — can last much longer than your breakouts. ","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" Even after lesions have healed, they can leave behind permanent reminders. While it’s difficult to avoid acne scarring completely, understanding the inner workings of your skin can help you minimize long-term damage. What causes acne scarring? In the simplest of terms, acne scars are visible reminders of injury and tissue repair. When tissue suffers an injury, the body rushes its “repair team” to the injury site. This specialized team includes white blood cells and an array of inflammatory molecules that work to fight infection and heal damaged tissue. Once the infection is gone, however, the tissue can’t always be restored to its former state. Who is most susceptible to acne scars? How and why people end up with acne scars is not completely understood. There is considerable variation between individuals, suggesting that some people are simply more prone to acne scarring than others. Acne Scar-susceptible people often find a genetic connection, as well — both the degree to which you scar and the kind of scar you get can \"run in the family.\" There is also considerable variation in the “life history” of individual scars; some people bear acne scars for a lifetime with little change, while others watch their scars diminish with time. We do know that scarring occurs most frequently in patients with the most severe forms of inflammatory acne, involving deep nodular lesions. How can I avoid acne scarring? Because we know so little about what causes one person to scar more easily than the next, the best way to avoid scarring is to prevent acne. It's important to treat the condition early in its course, and for as long as necessary. The more inflammation you can prevent, the less likely you are to scar. In the event that you do get acne lesions, it’s important to treat them with the proper medication rather than squeeze or pick at them. Handling the skin — squeezing with your fingernails, poking pimples with a pin, or whatever — significantly increases damage to surrounding tissue, and thereby increases the chance that the lesion will leave a permanent scar and acne scar treatment will be necessary. Remember A pimple that's bothering you today will go away soon if you let it be; if you pick at it, it could stick around forever. If you have a particularly troublesome lesion, see your dermatologist or aesthetician for safe, professional scar treatment or extraction. Another thing to remember A healthy body heals faster and more completely, so never underestimate the power of a healthy lifestyle. Eat a balanced diet, get plenty of rest and drink lots of water. If your work or play takes you out in the sun, protect yourself against harmful UVA and UVB rays with oil-free sunscreen; too much sun exposure can make scars stick around longer. Another habit that you know is bad — smoking — depletes your skin's valuable oxygen collagen reserves, causes free radical damage and deposits toxins, making it more vulnerable to aging and acne scarring.

As an acne blemish heals, the inflamed area flattens, leaving behind a reddish spot. Though it may look like an acne scar, it’s actually a macule — the final stage of an acne lesion. Macules may last for up to six months, but leave no permanent acne scar. The same holds true for post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, a darkening of the skin at the site of a healing acne lesion. Most prevalent in African-American, Asian and Latino populations, these spots can last up to 18 months — but may disappear more quickly if you stay out of the sun. Both macules and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation are considered \"pseudo-scarring\" because they eventually disappear completely. There are two kinds of true scars left behind by acne acne scars caused by increased tissue formation, and acne scars caused by tissue loss. The former, called keloid or hypertropic scars, are less common and appear to be hereditary. These are found primarily in African-American, Asian and Latino patients. Keloid scarring occurs when the skin cells respond to injury by producing an excess of collagen, which forms into lumpy fibrous masses most frequently along the jaw line and on the back or chest. These acne scars appear firm and shiny, and may persist for years. Acne scars caused by tissue loss are much more common, and may take many forms Soft acne scars have gentle sloping rolled edges that merge with the surrounding skin. They are usually small, circular or linear in shape, and soft to the touch. Ice-pick acne scars. Most often found on the cheek, ice-pick scars are usually small but deep, with a jagged edge and steep sides. If they are soft to the touch, they may be improved by stretching the skin; hard ice-pick scars are difficult to treat. Depressed fibrotic acne scars. Over time, ice-pick scars may evolve into depressed fibrotic scars. These also have sharp edges and steep sides, but are larger and firm at the base. Atrophic macules, a form of acne scarring most common in Caucasians, are soft with a slightly wrinkled base. Blood vessels just below the surface of the scar may make them appear purplish when they are recent, but this discoloration may fade over time to a pale ivory. Atrophic macules are usually small when they occur on the face, but may be a centimeter or larger elsewhere on the body. Follicular macular atrophy is more likely to occur on the chest or back of a person with acne. These small, soft white lesions resemble whiteheads that didn’t fully develop; they may persist for months or years. Can my acne scars be treated? The short answer is yes - acne scar treatment is available. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and macules can be improved with bleaching agents. Some superficial acne scarring can be treated with topical resurfacing agents, like Retinol, which is available in many over-the-counter forms, as well as in prescription medications such as Retin-A and Renova. Other forms of scarring can be improved with microdermabrasion (a minimum of 6–8 treatments are typically required) or dermatologic surgery. It may not be possible to restore your skin to its pre-acne appearance — but if your scars have a significant effect on your emotional well-being, it’s worth considering. There are a number of different scar treatments available; consult your dermatologist to find out if your particular situation may be improved, and how. "},{"title":" The Psychological Fallout Of Acne ","word_count":682,"summary":" Acne is more than just a skin condition, as it can cause a number of psychological problems in its wake. These problems, however, can be avoided if the acne is treated properly early on. ","keywords":" skin infections, infection, mental health, side effects, social anxiety, status anxiety, ","article_body":" Acne, whether the common teenage variety or the rarer adult variety, is one among several types of skin infections that could produce serious skin blemishes and aesthetically undesirable consequences. Aside from the obvious physical markings that come with the onset of the acne, there is also the possibility that the breakout would leave scars on the face. While only adult acne and a select few skin infections leave scars, these marks are often difficult and costly to remove. Facial scars due to acne can have serious  mental and social implications. Acne and skin infections can have mental health side effects that can be more serious than the infection itself since skin problems often have an effect on a person's self-esteem. A temporary bout of social anxiety is common among people who suffer from acne. Since most people view the skin as a visual indication of a person's physical well-being and hygiene, blemishes can often be perceived quite negatively. People can interpret the acne as signs of poor hygiene or physical health, as well as being possible signs of unhealthy dietary choices. Some people to slowly avoid people with acne, especially in communities or groups where physical attractiveness and “sameness” are critical to social survival, a situation found in a typical high school campus. This detachment, along with the acne patient's own perception – one that is all too often affected by outside influences – can result in social withdrawal. The acne sufferer's withdrawal and sense of being socially unacceptable can even worsen and lead to an onset of social anxiety in some cases. Another potential problem brought about by acne is status anxiety. As previously stated, some communities embrace a culture of “sameness” that causes members to subconsciously ostracize those who are perceived to be “different.” While extreme in interpretation, people with acne are often seen to be among those who are “different.”  But for the popular, high-ranking members of society, any sign of skin imperfection can even cause status anxiety.  Modern society often puts pressure on people to either retain their status or improve it, which is among the leading causes of stress and anxiety in people. This pressure is an underlying force behind social interactions with one's perceived peers and superiors, but can come into the foreground with the onset of acne. As acne becomes manifest, concern over one's physical appearance as a factor in one's social standing grows. Once a certain point, which is different for each person, has been reached, status anxiety sets in as the person becomes increasingly worried about how the “infection” will affect his status within his social circle. Perhaps among the more drastic effects of acne on the human psyche would be depression, though this is arguably more like a side effect of the previously mentioned issues. Typically, depression makes itself manifest if the acne has been prevalent for a prolonged period. As the social isolation continues, the patient also loses more and more confidence in his social skills and standing. This social anxiety, combined with worries over the perceived decline in his standing among his peers, can often make the situation seem hopeless for a person. The state of depression, which may only be perception and not an accurate reflection of the situation, can have dangerous consequences on a person's mental health. The possible psychological fallout caused by prolonged depression can easily outlast even the worst acne outbreak, with the possibility of becoming worse if the patient develops acne again later in life. The potential psychological fallout caused by acne should be a major concern for anyone who is fighting acne. As such, acne should be taken seriously and treated properly from the start. If over the counter medications are failing to alleviate the problem, then consult a professional for advice. Be sure to follow the instructions given for the acne medication, whether this is over-the-counter or prescribed, to minimize the chances of side effects occurring. While prescription acne treatments and acne scar removal surgery might seem expensive, they can prove to be worthwhile long-term investments when compared with the costs of therapy and anti-depressants.

Acne Treatment Cream</b> Perhaps the most common side effect of using acne treatment creams is allergic reaction. It ranges from redness, drying and flaking, itching and swelling of the skin. Feeling of burning is sometimes present too. Retin-A, a topical treatment for severe acne, may cause an already sensitive skin to become blistered, puffed and red. In some cases during its early usage, worse situation may occur especially in areas where acne attack is rather unseen. <b>2. Astringents</b> Just like acne treatment creams, astringents also exhibit the same side effects such as swelling, redness, dryness, itching or burning. It is recommended that the user should avoid excessive exposure to sunlight since skin discoloration may also occur. <b>3. Oral Antibiotics</b> As for other diseases, over exposure to antibiotics may lead to bacteria becoming resistant. The same goes with acne. Prolonged usage of antibiotics to treat acne may in turn lead to resistant bacterial infection. Tetracycline is one example of acne treatment antibiotic. Here are its common side effects 1. anemia 2. loss of appetite 3. nausea 4. fever 5. itchiness 6. photosensitivity or abnormal sensitivity of the skin to sunlight 7. rashes 8. allergic reactions 9. vision disturbance 10. dizziness 11. diarrhea 12. may affect a nursing infant therefore is not recommended for breastfeeding mothers and pregnant women Erythromycin, another common acne antibiotic, also has several side effects. Several users reported the following symptoms 1. nausea 2. diarrhea 3. seizures 4. confusion 5. mild to serious allergic reactions 6. abdominal pain All oral antibiotics have the ability to cause candidiasis or vaginal infections of yeast (by Candida albicans) in women. Among all acne oral antibiotics, Tetracycline appears to be the most common to have infection as its side effect. Also, oral antibiotics tend to lessen the potency of contraceptive pills. <b>4. Acne Laser Treatment</b> Acne laser treatment is intended to destroy the oil-producing glands of our skin, without destroying the epidermis or the outer skin layer, thus may be painful. It also produces temporary redness and swelling. Such symptomatic side effects of this kind of treatment may require additional treatment during the process of healing. Also, laser treatment may be left with uneven pigmentation on the skin. Aside from these physical side effects, laser treatment also needs to be done regularly and can be quite costly. <b>5. Cosmetic Procedures</b> Chemical peels are often used with creams to generate new skin cell growth. The result is a youthful looking skin. However they have side effects that include scarring, abnormal skin color, redness and blisters. <b>6. Acne Surgery</b> Not as popular as before, acne surgery has its share of side effects. Aside from scarring, there is also a possibility of developing serious infection when acne cysts are not carefully drained.

The reasons for this are many. After all, everyone gets acne to one degree or another. In most cases, it goes away on its own. While it's running its course, it is not a serious threat to anyone's overall physical health. In addition, until the last couple of decades, there was very little anyone could do to treat it. Acne, nonetheless, has a significant impact on a person's outlook on life. Recent studies have detected the following as common among people with acne * Social withdrawal * Decreased self-esteem * Reduced self-confidence * Poor body image * Embarrassment * Feelings of depression * Anger * Preoccupation * Frustration * Higher rate of unemployment The effects listed above are often interrelated, with one effect leading to another and another, only to make the first effect worse. These negative psychosocial effects can have a crippling impact, discouraging patients from pursuing life's opportunities--socially, on the job, or at school. Actual quotes from people with acne The fact is, people with acne generally hate the way they look with acne. Let people with acne tell you-here are some testimonials about living with acne* Verbatim #1 \"I don't look in mirrors.... I am like a vampire--I shy away from mirrors. I comb my hair using my silhouette on the wall to show the outline of my head. I have not looked myself in the eyes in years, and is painful not to be able to do that, and that is a direct result of acne, the acne scarring.\" Like a vampire, hating mirrors! Unable to face himself, how can this person hope to face the world? Verbatim #2 \"I think that if I had more self-esteem about the way I looked, I think I would have been more outgoing. I would have gone to more parties. I probably would have been more outspoken in class and would not have felt so insecure about going up and speaking in front of a group of classmates.\" Here is an extrovert, turned in on himself (or herself) because of acne. Who knows how different things would have been if he didn't have acne? Verbatim #3 \"It is really humiliating to feel like I have no control over my acne. I hold my head down and I am ashamed to look at people, embarrassed. I am 25 years old and to be acting this way is very frustrating.\" In just three sentences, this person revealed humiliation, lack of control, shame, embarrassment and frustration. With the treatments available today, there is no reason to suffer like this. Verbatim #4 \"It's associated with being dirty, and I hate that, because it's not at all like that. I inherited it from my mother, and she's always telling me that she had the exact same thing and that it will go away. I am mad that I inherited it from her. My dad makes me feel bad because he never had bad skin when he was younger, so he doesn't understand.... I hate that the first thing people see when they look at me is bad skin. I really. really hate that.\" Myths about acne are a common source of family conflict. Teenagers tend to be rebellious anyway--do they need to have acne misinformation driving another wedge between them and their parents? One myth that makes this family situation worse The notion that nothing can be done to clear serious acne sooner than if it were left alone. Verbatim #5 \"I feel like I don't look right no matter how hard I try to dress up and look nice--there is always that area of pimples there, and it is very unsettling. There really hasn't been a day gone by that I don't think about it, or look at my face.... Should I spend that much energy on it? I could be doing other things...instead of wasting 5 to 10 minutes every day looking at my face in the mirror, or playing with it, picking at my acne.\" This person is so preoccupied with acne that he almost neurotically picks at it. He is also clearly frustrated, as acne thwarts all attempts at achieving a good appearance. These testimonials show the extent of the psychological, emotional and social disturbances that acne can cause. Clearing up the acne would relieve the source of these disturbances, but many people don't realize that something can be done. Many myths about acne, especially regarding diet and hygiene, are still considered to be true. And many parents and older siblings are stuck in the attitude of past generations that nothing can really be done but wait it out. Making matters worse, there is confusion among people with acne and their families about what works and what doesn't. They are often frustrated by products that promise to clear skin but that don't work for them. Some nonprescription products may be more effective than others, but dermatologists have treatments that work just about 100% of the time. Most cases of acne can be cleared up with the right treatment.

","keywords":" acne. acnes, faqs, faq, FAQ, FAQS, ACNE, ACNES ","article_body":" Have you ever washed your face more than twice a day to clear up your skin?  Do you avoid chocolate and greasy foods in the hopes that when you look in the mirror, you won’t see another blemish?  Have you ever drank more water, or avoided or increased your exercise to prevent acne flare-ups?  If you answered yes to any of the above questions, you’re not alone. Acne is one of the most common skin disorders affecting nearly 85 percent of all people.  While the variety of effective acne treatments continues to grow, so does the number of myths about how to control the condition. “Although new acne treatments are developed every day, a cure for acne has not yet been discovered.  As such, many patients choose to self-treat or experiment with unconventional treatments,” stated by a doctor.  “Yet many of these treatments are based on anecdotal observations and have not been rigorously tested by science.  The survey indicates that these myths are still affecting how patients care for their acne.” Myth Poor Hygiene Worsens Acne The relationship between face washing and acne has always been greatly misunderstood, with most individuals believing that dirt and poor hygiene contribute to acne.  In fact, a recent survey conducted at Stanford University asked participants about what they thought made acne worsen, and the majority, 91 percent, mentioned poor hygiene.  “If a patient believes that dirty skin causes acne, they logically conclude that washing their face more often will improve their acne,” said by a doctor.  “But dermatologists caution patients against washing too often, as the resulting irritation can exacerbate their acne.” To determine the scientific validity of this myth, the effects of face washing on acne were recently studied at Stanford University.  A group of twenty-four males washed their faces twice a day for two weeks using a mild over-the-counter facial cleanser.  Then the participants were randomly selected to wash their faces either once, twice or four times a day for another six weeks.  The study found that washing the face either once, twice or four times daily did not significantly change the appearance or condition of acne, and determined that the positive effects of increased facial cleansing are minimal at best.  Dermatologists continue to recommend washing the face twice daily to maintain good overall skin health. Myths Exercise Can Clear Acne or Exercise Can Worsen Acne The relationship between acne and exercise continues to show high levels of individual variability.  Some believe that exercise and sweating can help clean out the pores, especially on the chest and back; while others note that their skin worsens when they exercise, especially those who use special equipment that rubs against their skin. In another study conducted at Stanford University of patients with acne, it was determined that exercise-induced sweat does not have a significant positive or negative influence on acne of the chest and back.  Twenty-three male participants were assigned to three groups no exercise, regular exercise followed by immediate showering and regular exercise followed by delayed showering.  The number of acne lesions on the chest and back were counted over a two week period and no difference was noted between the three groups.  “Based on the finding of this study, regular exercise can be encouraged for patients with acne,” stated Dr. Boer Kimball.  “But they should avoid tight-fitting clothing and equipment.  If tight-fitting equipment is required, it should be cleaned on a regular basis.” Other Acne Myths While misconceptions about facial hygiene and exercise are still the most commonly recognized acne beliefs, the Stanford survey also found that respondents believed that poor diet and decreased sleep can negatively affect acne.  In addition, more than 80 percent of participants believed that increased stress, touching the face and popping pimples exacerbated the condition.  Among male and female participants, the only differences noted were that more females believed that increased stress could worsen acne and that drinking more water would improve the quality of their skin.  The study also found that some beliefs that were previously popular about acne were no longer viewed as true, including the idea that tanning improves the appearance of acne. “What this survey and these studies have shown is that substantial differences still exist between popular belief and scientific support, yet this does not change the way patients attempt to care for their acne,” stated by a doctor.  “It is important for anyone who is affected by acne to seek the help of a dermatologist who can diagnose and provide treatment options that are specific to the patient’s skin type to effectively address the condition.” Headquartered in Schaumburg, Ill., the American Academy of Dermatology (Academy), founded in 1938, is the largest, most influential, and most representative of all dermatologic associations.  With a membership of more than 14,000 physicians worldwide, the Academy is committed to advancing the diagnosis and medical, surgical and cosmetic treatment of the skin, hair and nails; advocating high standards in clinical practice, education, and research in dermatology; and supporting and enhancing patient care for a lifetime of healthier skin, hair and nails.

Find out what you should - and shouldn't - be doing as part of your skin care regimen. ","keywords":" acne skin care, treatment, remedy, medicine, cure, curing, scars, cleanser, facial, pore, natural ","article_body":" Let's face it, you are engaged in an ongoing battle when you are afflicted with acne. While acne treatments for a mild case of acne are usually successful, moderate acne is a greater problem. Even dermatologists cannot cure a severe case of acne but can only provide an acne treatment regimen. However, you can support your acne treatment efforts with proper acne skin care in order to reduce the recurrence of acne flare-ups and not aggravate existing acne. Knowing What You're Doing One of the first pieces of advice is to make sure that you understand and follow the directions for any acne remedy that you are using. If you are taking a prescription acne medicine, read the patient leaflet that accompanies the medication carefully. Typically for moderate to severe acne a dermatologist may prescribe several acne medicines, each with its own treatment protocol and directions. In order to achieve the acne free skin that you desire, it is important to use all the acne treatments properly and in the correct order. Consider bringing a tablet of paper, a pen, and a friend or relative with you to your appointment with your dermatologist.  Simply jot down some notes about the order and time of day for applying each acne medicine and what its purpose is. Remember, just because the acne clears with the use of your acne medicines doesn’t necessarily mean that you have succeeded in curing acne. Most people with moderate to severe acne must continue to use their acne medicine long-term to prevent any recurrence of their acne problem. Using the acne treatments properly should translate to clear skin and freedom from acne scars. What About Over-the-Counter Remedies? Besides using medications prescribed by a doctor, there are a large number of products on the market labeled as skin cleansers, facial cleansers, pore cleansers, and facial pore cleaners that can be used in curing acne. When cleansing skin that is afflicted with acne, an important point to remember is not to scrub the skin; never scrub your face with a washcloth. It is a misconception that acne is caused by dirt clogging the pores of the skin. You don’t scrub away the offending dirt; you can’t scrub away the offensive acne and achieve acne free skin. Over-washing or scrubbing skin afflicted with acne only serves to aggravate the condition. Rather use only a gentle skin cleanser, lukewarm water, and a gentle motion with your fingertips as your primary acne skin care regime. When you wash your face with your hands, be sure to first thoroughly wash your hands. Do Natural Treatments Really Work? Look for gentle cleansers that are sold as acne solutions. When you're evaluating skin cleansers for acne, include natural acne treatments in your search as well. For example, a soap made from Echinacea and other herbal ingredients is an effective antibiotic facial cleanser that helps fight acne and restore clear skin. Tea tree oil also has known antibiotic properties and serves as a mild anesthetic that will soothe the irritated skin. Oily skin is implicated as a one of the causes of acne. It doesn’t necessarily make sense to use a moisturizer on oily skin as a means of achieving clear skin. But many of the acne treatments, whether they are prescribed or available as over-the-counter products, have a tendency to irritate the skin while curing acne. A moisturizer is a boost to irritated skin and keeps skin from becoming overly dry due to the acne treatments that have been applied. Look for a moisturizer with the following properties - oil-free - won’t clog pores (non-comodogenic) - containing a sun-screen Besides a great desire to just scrub away the acne, many people try to remove the acne pimples by hand as a way to get clear skin. People who are afflicted with acne should avoid touching their face except to gently wash it with mild cleanser as already discussed. By trying to remove pimples by hand you run the risk of creating acne scars that will last for a lifetime. Instead, have patience and rely on your prescription or over-the-counter acne treatment to work. Acne remedies usually take 6 to 8 weeks before curing acne. For male acne sufferers, the daily ritual of shaving can be a problem. One acne sufferer has recommended the Gillette Sensor Excel as a gentle and effective razor to use. Other males prefer to try an electric razor. The advice is to shave delicately to avoid nicking the skin and to shave only as often as necessary. Finding a moisturizing shave gel may be one way to enhance your acne skin care program. Female acne sufferers have their unique problems too, in finding the right cosmetic products to use. Females who are accustomed to using a foundation product may find that the foundation is difficult to apply smoothly if the facial skin becomes irritated due to the acne treatments being applied. You may have to abandon the use of some cosmetics during the acne treatment period. Be sure to select only oil-free cosmetics and ones that are labeled as non-comodogenic (won’t clog pores) to use on your road to clear skin. Proper acne skin care is a necessary addition to your arsenal for fighting your battle with acne and achieving clear skin once again.

Acne occurs when there is an excessive secretion of sebum, a substance from the hair follicles.  The excess secretion becomes the target for dust and bacteria to accumulate to later develop into acne. Acne can affect people of all ages and races.  But occurrence of acne is very high among adolescent people.  According to studies, almost 85 percent of adolescents and young adults within the age range of 12 and 24 years old develop acne to a varying degree. During adolescence, the hormonal levels of a person become elevated and they stimulate the sebaceous glands which are attached to the hair follicles.  As an effect, greater amount of sebum is secreted. The ages of 10 and 13 are when young people are most vulnerable to acne.  Normally, acne usually lasts for 5 to 10 years although there are many cases where one experiences acne up until a later age. People with poor hygiene are at a risk of getting acne.  Since acne is caused by bacteria, people who are exposed to dust and dirty and do not wash their faces during bed time will most likely develop acne.  Also, a person who uses dirty pillowcases will have higher risk of getting acne. Acne can also be inherited.  So people who have a family history with acne will be at risk of developing acne too. People who take certain drugs like those used to treat epilepsy and depression may be at risk of acne breakout. Acne affects both men and women.  But among men, the likelihood of getting more severe and long lasting forms of acme is higher compared to women.  Even then, more women have close relationships with their dermatologists than men. Intermittent acne affects women due to hormonal changes that usually come with their menstrual cycle.  This kind of acne is also caused by excessive use of cosmetics. Some cosmetics, especially those which are not oil-free or non-comedogenic may actually affect the pores of the skin and later develop acne. More women compared to men are getting infected with perioral dermatitis characterized by small pustules and papules form on the chin and around the mouth. Men and women who love to wear tight hats, backpacks, jeans, or any tight gear and paraphernalia are at risk with developing acne because skin friction can create irritation and may eventually trigger acne. Middle aged adults are most likely to get affected with Acne Rosacea.  The effect of this kind of acne includes flushed face and red nose due to inflamed bumps. Infantile acne affects newborn babies.  This is a mild kind of acne caused by fetal hormones.  After a few weeks, infantile acne just naturally disappears. More men are affected with a severe form of acne called Acne conglobata.  This kind of acne is an advanced form of nodular cystic acne vulgaris and this can extensively attack the face, chest and back. Another interesting study states that occurrence of acne is higher among Caucasians compared to other colors. "},{"title":" The Vicious Cycle of Antidepressant Drugs and Acne ","word_count":565,"summary":" For a few years now, the use of antidepressants has been scrutinized due to  rumors that they cause acne. In more recent times, acne medication has also taken the blame for having the side effect of causing short-term depression. For the time being, the medical community is warning against taking both types of drugs at the same time without doctor's supervision. ","keywords":" antidepressant drugsc ","article_body":" In today's world, depression ought to be a major concern. Thousands are reported to suffer from the problem. Potentially thousands more cases of depression are going by unreported and untreated. The fact that sales of antidepressant drugs are fairly consistent serves as concrete proof that the condition is a problem. It has become such a concern that most organizations and systems designed to deal with suicide focus on spotting people with depression, inadvertently ignoring other suicide triggers. While antidepressant drugs are known to be effective in helping ward off the symptoms, there are other things that people have to be concerned over. Acne is also a problem, though hardly one that is as large a concern as depression ought to be. Unlike mental disorders, acne is easily spotted because it has tell-tale physical signs that mark its presence. On their own, these marks are relatively minor concerns at best and are frustrating annoyances in most cases. However, it is the wide range of side effects that acne can have that is considered to be the real problem. With a myriad of social troubles in store for anyone that develops acne, it is understandable that some would worry about their physical appearance and social standing. This social isolation can result in someone developing depression and turning to antidepressant drugs to help dull the pain. However, depending on the drug, this might just inadvertently make things worse. For a few years, some antidepressant drugs have been cited as having the side effect of causing acne. In this regard, zoloft is often cited as the primary culprit. There is no concrete medical evidence of such, but there has been more than adequate evidence to prompt various organizations to conduct research. There is also enough evidence to convince some to avoid taking zoloft and other chemically similar antidepressant drugs to avoid developing acne. There have also been reports of a sort of reversal of this problem manifesting in some patients. In particular, some of the newer topical drugs used to combat acne are being cited as having the side effect of causing users to become depressed. Again, there is little actual chemical evidence, but some pharmaceutical companies have conducted research into the matter and have admitted that there is a possibility. This puts people in a rather interesting situation. There have been some reports of people with acne taking anti-acne medication and becoming depressed, even as the acne fades. One possibility that might occur from this can result in a patient continually taking antidepressants to combat his depression, which are caused by acne that are the side effect of the very same antidepressants he's taking in the first place. While the chances of something of that sort happening are relatively low, it can still happen and most of the medical community would rather not have to deal with such a bizarre outcome. There have also been reports of patients with depression developing acne after being treated with certain antidepressant drugs. These cases have not been directly related to either acne medication or antidepressant drugs, but there are some that believe they've found chemical evidence hinting towards a connection. For the time being, however, the medical community is still skeptical. There are warnings against taking anti-acne and antidepressants at the same time, but this is only as a precaution until concrete evidence one way or the other can be determined.

You may find something that works for you from your very own bathroom or kitchen. The main purpose of an acne medication is to unclog your pores and calm inflammation. Acne home remedies are usually not for extreme cases, but more aimed at the mild to occasional blemishes. Some acne home remedies sound a little silly, and are not tested or proven by a real dermatologist. Some home remedies may worsen your condition or not effect it at all. You should be aware of this possibility before you try any of these. Common acne home remedies include salt water, toothpaste, egg whites, ice, apple cider vinegar, steam, or wheat germ. Washing your face with warm, mild salt water dries up excess acne-inducing oils. The advantage to using this instead of a normal soap to wash your face is that it is less likely to aggravate the acne or your skin. Applying a bit of toothpaste on a visible pimple before you go to sleep helps reduce swelling. It also keeps the area free of oils that could make the spot worse. Be sure to use an actual paste because a gel will not have the same effect. This is the most common of all the acne home remedies. Dab egg whites on a pimple that is already on the surface. If you leave it on overnight, it is said to draw out the infection and speed up the healing process. Holding a cube of ice on acne before bed should visibly decrease the inflammation and swelling. It may also reduce the chances of scarring after your skin has cleared up. Placing a cotton ball into apple cider Vinegar and then applying it to your infected area will almost instantly reduce swelling. This works especially well for large inflamed spots. You are always advised not to squeeze any pimples, however, blackheads will not go away on their own. Opening your pores using steam to can assist you when you are cleaning your face. Take a hot shower or put your head over the vapors of a boiling pot of water. Wheat germ, which can be found in most stores, is one of the only acne home remedies taken internally.

With so many acne medications available over-the-counter or by prescription, it can be frustrating finding one that works. But something out there will work for you if you just keep trying. If you find that you are getting nowhere with your acne, try finding something more specific to your skin type.

Do not be discouraged if a product that you try makes your acne worse. Sometimes we must take a step back to make progress. Make a note of the ingredients in what you used and, in the future, only use medicines that do not contain any or much of this. You should always read the labels before purchasing a product. You wouldn't order a dish at a restaurant if you didn't know what was in it, would you? If you skin is oily, then you may choose to purchase something that is especially for treating oily skin. If your skin is too sensitive for OTC acne medications that you have tried, then perhaps you should consult a Dermatologist. Some forms of acne can not be treated without a prescription. The doctor may prescribe an oral antibiotic instead of a topical acne medication for severe cases. These are commonly used to decrease inflammation that can contribute to acne. Topical prescription acne medication for severe cases of acne usually contains retinoids. Retinoids prevent blackheads and whiteheads, while un-clogging your pores. The downside to this is that you could have increased sensitivity to the sun or develop an irritation. It is possible for fine lines and wrinkles to be reduces with this treatment, which is a bonus advantage to having younger and healthier looking skin.

If you experiment with these, you may end up with a cheap solution to your acne. Peroxide could speed up the healing process of existing acne. It kills germs to drastically reduce inflammation. Toothpaste can be applied lightly on spots that appear before the actual acne has formed. Usually, this is left on overnight and washed off in the morning. It dries up excess oils that can contribute to the formation of acne. Pure alcohol should never be applied to the skin. However, if you dilute it half with water to gently wash your face, you can dry up excess oils without completely drying out your skin. Acne is a common problem and getting treated is nothing to be ashamed of. No one should have to live with the embarrassment of acne.

Some treatments may not completely remove all scars but the appearance of most of them will lessen dramatically. Your doctor's recommendation toward a certain procedure depends on the type and severity of the scarring. Dermabrasion is a procedure done under local anesthetic in which the doctor will remove the top layers of skin with a sanding instrument. It is one of the most effective treatments available for facial scar removal. It is not recommended for people with darker skin because it could reveal lighter layers of skin, which could cause another problem with your appearance. Collagen injections are a less permanent solution to acne scars. They generally last from 3-6 months and require future injections to maintain their effect. Steroid injections are a long term treatment for acne scar removal. The side effects of this procedure are minimal, but there is a chance that the scars will still remain visible. Laser treatment is still in an experimental phase. The use of a vasecular laser may fade the color of scars. A carbon dioxide laser may flatten scars and resurface the skin, however this effect is not definite. This procedure is not recommended due to the uncertainty in the safety of the treatment. Radiotherapy is a controversial treatment and is only recommended for extreme cases. It is used to prevent the reoccurrence of severe scarring. The long-term side effects, even in the small doses of this treatment, is the risk of cancer induced by radiation. A chemical peel is a minor form of surgery that can be done by a cosmetologist. This is usually the solution to getting rid of minor scarring. A layer of skin is removed by the application of chemicals. Afterwards, a new layer of skin can form and reduce your scars. For some people, more than one type of treatment is necessary for the best outcome. Each person's face and skin are different and it is necessary to research these and other procedures available for you. Realistically, some people may not get rid of the appearance of scars completely. Choosing the right dermatologist is as important as choosing your treatment. Qualifications and experience are key factors to look at. You can read about a dermatologist in any area online (www.IEnhance.com/physician).

They are all generally called acne but when it comes to treatment, it is important to know exactly what is going on with your skin. People with acne are usually familiar with whiteheads (milium), however they don't know what causes them or how to get rid of them. The difference between this and a blackhead is that blackheads are exposed to oxygen which causes the black appearance. A whitehead is a build-up of oils and dead skin that plugs up your pores. It is embedded under the skin so it appears as a raised white bump. These are also referred to as \"closed comedones\". This is because the pore is not open and oxygen never comes in contact with it. They are caused by hardened oils under the skin that are clogging the pores, which is the cause of most acne to begin with. Some dermatologists believe that people with frequent outbreaks may produce a drier oil than normal, which makes them susceptible to getting clogged pores. If you wear make-up, avoid using anything that is greasy to prevent all forms acne. Another acne preventing precaution is to wash your pillowcase regularly as well as your hair.

Androgens, a hormone that begins production at puberty, is a major cause of acne. Unfortunately for males, they tend to produce more androgens and develop more severe acne than females. Extra oils that contribute to acne, are also produced at puberty. These oils mixed with dirt and dead skin cause the pore blockage which causes acne. Some females will get break-outs around the time of their monthly period. This is caused by the hormone fluctuations caused by menstruation. Fortunately for females with hormonal break-outs, birth control can help to maintain a steady level of hormones. A common misconception about teens with acne is that they have bad hygiene or eat a lot of greasy food. This is only a myth, and proves untrue for most people. Wash your face twice a day, especially after exercise, to get rid of excess oil. Avoid harsh soaps that can irritate and damage skin. Never pick your face because this could lead to increased irritation and life-long scarring. Stress can be a cause of acne for teens. Unfortunately, this is an inevitably stressful phase of life. Teens with acne suffer from the emotional side of acne just as much as the physical side. Your face is the first thing that most people see when they look at you.

Some teens develop social anxiety that can interfere with every aspect of day to day life Some teens with acne decide to purchase topical cleansers from the store when they first start to develop acne. Sensitive skin will not react well with most over-the-counter treatments. It can cause itching, redness, burning, and general worsening of the condition.

It’s called facial massaging and for me, a former acne patient, it works. Now friends, I suffered from acne. Actually the statement above will be an understatement. It devastated and almost annihilated me. What didn’t I try Proactiv, Neutrogena, Clearasil, Dermatologists? You name it, this writer tried it. Well, not everything, cause I couldn’t afford plastic surgery, not on a $11 per hour salary, but I was saving up for it though…honestly, the phone number is still highlighted in the phone book. During my years with dealing with acne, especially toward the end as an adult, I simply had to find something, anything to get this problem off or else… Well, thank God I stumbled on Facial Massaging and combined with a proper diet and other common-sense tips, within 72 hours or less, there was a permanent and drastic improvement in my skin condition. I humbly share the facial massaging steps with you so if you suffer from acne, you could look into them as part of a drug-free, yet simple BUT extremely effective means of treating your acne. Facial Massaging Steps 1. Wash your hands, especially your fingertips, thoroughly. 2. Now with your thumbs firmly gripping your jaw-line, proceed to pressing with the free four fingers the upper jaw line working from the center outwards. Do 2-3 sets pressing firmly. 3. Now press the areas directly above the jaw line in the same center-going- outwards-direction firmly 2-3 times. 4. Do this working upwards till you reach the forehead line. If done correctly you should see little specks of dead skin on your face. 5. In a feathery motion, pinch at the entire face for as long as you desire (1-2 minutes) using all the free fingers in firm actions grasping the skin. 6. Now, in a downward-scraping motion using the finger tips, rub the jugular veins located at the sides of the neck (6-8) times, and then massage the outer part of the chest right next to the armpits in a firm circular motion ensuring you breathe deeply as well. According to the Egyptians (and from my own experiences) this simple procedure has a marked effect on alleviating bags and crow's feet from the eyes and directing the flow of toxins away from the face. 7. Wash your hands with soap and rinse the face with cool water only-gently but firmly. 8. Wipe your face dry with a paper towel (or a towel you use only for your face and nothing else. Keep this towel in an exclusive location and wash it every other day). Now, for an external acne treatment regimen, this procedure is quite effective.  Combined with such internal acne treatment procedures based on a proper diet of your Juicy fruits, some roots and leafy vegetables and if desired (although highly recommended) occasional juice fasts or exclusive mono-meals of seasonal fruits, facial massaging will be very useful as a means of controlling acne (and delaying facial aging as apparent in crows feet and wrinkles) from the outside. I must add, when performed correctly, it does enhance facial tone and structure not unlike costly plastic surgery. So, put your fingers to work and lovingly massage and sculpt your face with facial massaging while all the while becoming acne free starting today. Here’s to a clearer skin naturally.

The processes that cause acne are exactly the same in people with black or brown skin but the impact is altered by the skin pigmentation. Acne is very common and affects about 80 in 100 people aged 11-30 at some time.4 The skin The surface of the skin has lots of small sebaceous glands just below the surface. These glands make an oily substance called sebum that keeps the skin smooth and supple. Tiny pores (holes in the skin) allow the sebum to come to the skin surface. Hairs also grow through these pores. IIllustration showing the structure of skin Illustration showing the structure of skin What causes acne? Acne is caused by the overactivity of the sebaceous glands that secrete oily substances onto the skin. The sebaceous glands of people with acne are especially sensitive to normal blood levels of a hormone called testosterone, found naturally in both men and women. Testosterone in people prone to acne triggers the sebaceous glands to produce an excess of sebum. At the same time, the dead skin cells lining the openings of the hair follicles (the tubes that hold the hair) are not shed properly and clog up the follicles. These two effects combined cause a build-up of oil in the hair follicles. This causes blackheads and whiteheads to form. For some people, their acne does not progress beyond this stage. However in other people, the build-up of oil in the hair follicles creates an ideal environment for a bacterium called Propionibacterium acnes to grow. These bacteria normally live harmlessly on your skin but when this ideal environment is created, they grow. They feed off the sebum and produce substances that cause a response from your body's immune system. This inflames the skin and creates the redness associated with spots. In more severe 'inflammatory acne', cysts develop beneath the skin's surface. These acne cysts can rupture, spreading the infection into nearby skin tissue. This can result in scarring. What makes acne worse? There are a number of things that can make your acne worse. These include the following * picking and squeezing the spots may cause further inflammation and scarring1 * stress can make acne worse in some people, although it is not clear why1, * in women, outbreaks may be affected by the hormonal changes that occur during the menstrual cycle1, * excessive production of male hormones such as testosterone from conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome may be another cause.5 For more information, please see the separate BUPA factsheet Polycystic ovary syndrome * some contraceptive pills may make acne worse. This is due to the type of progestogen hormone in some pills whereas some other types of contraceptive pills can improve acne - see Treatments section below. Your GP will advise you which contraceptive pill to take * some medicines can make acne worse. For example, some medicines taken for epilepsy, and steroid creams and ointments that are used for eczema. Do not stop a prescribed medicine if you suspect it is making your acne worse, but tell your GP. An alternative may be an option * steroids can cause acne as a side-effect Treatment Acne may cause you considerable emotional distress but there is a range of treatment options to help you tackle the problem.

The aims of treatment are to prevent new spots forming, to improve those already present, and to prevent scarring.3 Home treatment It is important to keep spot-prone areas clean, so wash the affected area twice a day with an unperfumed cleanser.1,6 The skin needs a certain amount of oil to maintain its natural condition, so avoid aggressive washing with strong soaps. There are a number of over-the-counter remedies available from pharmacies to treat mild acne. These usually contain antibacterial agents such as benzoyl peroxide (eg Oxy and Clearasil Max). As well as its antibacterial effects, benzoyl peroxide can dry out the skin and encourage it to shed the surface layer of dead skin. Together, these effects make it harder for pores to become blocked and for infection to develop. Benzoyl peroxide can cause redness and peeling, especially to start with. This tends to settle down if you reduce the number of times you use it. You can then build up your use gradually. No home treatments for acne will work immediately. It can take weeks, if not months, for significant effects to be noticeable. If home treatments have not worked after two months, or you have severe acne, you should visit your GP. Prescription medicines Your GP may start your treatment by prescribing a preparation containing benzoyl peroxide. If this does not work, or if you have more severe acne, there are a range of other treatment options that you can either rub onto your skin (topical) or take in tablet form (oral). Topical treatments There are several topical treatments you may be prescribed including those listed below * azelaic acid (Skinoren) is an alternative to benzoyl peroxide and may not make your skin as sore as benzoyl peroxide * topical retinoids (eg Adapalene) are medicines based on vitamin A, which are rubbed into the skin once or twice a day.7 They work by encouraging the outer layer of skin to flake off * a topical antibiotic lotion applied to the skin can be used to control the P. acnes bacteria (eg Dalacin T). Treatment needs to continue for at least six months. Preparations that combine an antibiotic with other acne medication are available (eg Benzamycin which combines an antibiotic with benzoyl peroxide) Oral treatments There are several oral treatments you may be prescribed including those listed below * oral antibiotics (tablets), such as tetracycline, can be prescribed for inflammatory acne. They should be taken daily for around three months, although it might take four to six months for the benefits to be seen.7 The success of this treatment can be limited because the strains of bacteria are often resistant to the common antibiotics. Antibiotics do not prevent pores from becoming blocked so treatment to prevent blackheads, such as benzoyl peroxide, is often also prescribed at the same time * some types of oral contraceptive tablets help women who have acne. A combination of the usual pill hormone called ethinylestradiol with cyproterone acetate (eg Dianette) suppresses male hormone activity so is often used in women with acne * isotretinoin (eg Roaccutane) is a medicine known as an oral retinoid, which also exists in a topical form (see above). Isotretinoin works by drying up oily secretions. It tends to be prescribed to people with severe forms of acne that have proved resistant to other treatments. There a number of serious side-effects of this drug, such as liver disorders and depresssion. You should not take isotretinoin if you are pregnant, as it is very dangerous to an unborn baby. For safety reasons, isotretinoin is only prescribed under the supervision of dermatology specialists.

Treatments are important to avoid complications. When simple treatments are not enough, perhaps it is time to consider medical options for the acnes. The top three acne medications are the following 1.\tBenzoyl peroxide This anti-bacterial medication takes care of killing the P. Acnes, acne-causing bacteria. It is an antiseptic agent that reduces the amount of barren pores. It will take approximately 3 weeks to see the changes. This ingredient is also used for bleaching the hair and fabric so make sure to use it right. It is both over-the-counter and prescription drug that comes in gel or cream. There is an estimated 3% of individuals found to be allergic to such substance so make sure that you don’t belong to that group or else you will experience skin inflammation if you apply it on your skin. 2.\tSalicylic Acid Used to treat skin disorders such as dandruff, calluses, and warts, salicylic acid can also be used as an acne medication. It slows down the cells in the follicles from cracking which prevents blockage. It also assists in breaking down the whiteheads and blackheads. Salicylic acid comes in many forms including cream, gel, lotion, ointment, and many more. Only use the medicine according to the directions on the label recommendations or from the doctor; otherwise, it may result to acid poisoning. Poisoning can be noticed when the person using it experiences dizziness, diarrhea, deep breathing, etc. 3.\tSulfur This ingredient is common among soaps, washes, and creams. It allows the skin to peel and dry enabling the breaking down of the whiteheads and blackheads. It is necessary to check the label directions so as to avoid unnecessary complications. It is always best to seek professional advice when taking any of the medications. It is better to be sure. These medications, however, only kills bacteria, slows down cell breakdown, and peels off the skin but it will never stop the skin from acquiring bacteria after a certain span of time.

Acne is a common eruption of the hair follicles and oil-producing glands of the skin. Acne usually is found on the face, neck, and upper body. Pimples and blackheads are caused by the increase in hormones adolescence or before a woman's period and by bacterial infections of the skin. Waste and toxins are eliminated by the skin through sweat pores. Thus, constipation or irregular bowel movements worsen the problem and need to corrected in acne treatment. While there no one \"\"\"\"best acne treatment\"\"\"\" the following are the top five natural acne treatments which should be considered by anyone seeking an acne solution. <b>1. Supplements and Vitamins for Acne Treatment</b> Zinc – 50 milligrams, 2 times per day. If Zinc Picolinate is used (due to superior absorption) 50 milligrams is taken only once a day. Vitamin A – 100,000 Units per day for 2 months. Excess Vitamin A be toxic to the liver and needs to be used under a physician's supervision. Pregnant women (or women who may become pregnant) should not take more than 10,000 Units per day. Vitamin B3 (Niacinamide) –  topical gel, containing 4% Niacinamide, applied twice per day. Vitamin B6 – 100 milligrams per day, especially if acne is associated with the menstrual period. Vitamin C – 1,000 milligrams, 4 times a day. Reduce dosage if diarrhea occurs. Vitamin E – 600 Units per day. Pantothenic Acid - 2.5 grams, four times per day, orally. In research, this has been used together with a topical cream containing 20% Pantothenic acid which was applied four to six times per day. Deodorized garlic, 10 to 16 capsules per day, depending on the severity of the acne and until symptoms improve. Reduce this dosage gradually, over a 3-week period, to 4 capsules per day. Evening Primrose oil or Linseed oil – 2 capsules per day. Most of these supplements can be taken in a multivitamin tablet and extra Vitamin A and Zinc. <b>2. Proper Diet as an Acne Solution</b> Increase fruits and vegetables in the diet. Eat at least 2 pieces of fruit and 1 cup of vegetables daily. Eliminate sugar and sugar containing foods because sugar increases the fats that are secreted by the sebaceous glands. These are the glands that are infected by bacteria when a person has acne. Limit junk foods, fatty foods, fried foods, and milk products. All these foods tend to aggravate acne. <b>3 The Herbal Acne Remedy</b> A tea can be made from equal parts of Oregon Grape Root, Dandelion Root, and Burdock Root. Brew 1 teaspoon of this mixture per cup of boiling water. Simmer 5 minutes, then steep for 15 minutes. Up to 6 cups per day for 12 days are taken, or less if nausea or an upset stomach occurs. A tea of Vitex has often been considered useful, especially when premenstrual symptoms and hormonal imbalances are involved. <b>4. Physical Treatments in Acne Care</b> Exposing the skin to sunshine and fresh air or to the light of a tanning lamp, but not long enough to burn the skin. Overexposure to tanning lights may increase the risk of skin cancer. <b>5. Homeotherapy Acne Skin Care Products</b> Silica 6C and Hepar sulph 6C Each day, 3 pellets of Silica in the early morning and afternoon and 3 pellets of Hepar sulph at noon time and in the evening. The pellets are dissolved under the tongue. Note A wide range of homeopathic medicines can be effective acne treatment solutions.

After all, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. So, here are five of the basic but most important ways in order to treat and prevent acne build up. 1. Cleaning Washing away the outside layer of the skin with natural oils is not really helpful preventing or curing acne, or pimple for other people, for it develops under the skin. Although it's a belief the people develop acne due to the fact that they don't cleanse their skin thoroughly. For everyone's information, washing the skin too much can cause irritation and produces more whiteheads and blackheads that turn into pimples after being infected. Gentle washing is only needed. Use mild soaps or cleanser, an example is Cetaphil or acne bars. Another good sample is Neutrogena product that washes acne. 2. Exfoliating It is also important to exfoliate; this helps remove the dead skin cells, to maintain a healthy and glowing skin. A mild cleanser will help exfoliate the face after washing. Scrubbing will also help exfoliate the face, which can be done once or twice a week. This procedure will aid in reducing dead layers skin cells that clog the pores, reason why more pimples or acne. 3. Keeping the skin Clear - Make sure that all cosmetics such as powder, lotion, blush on, foundation, and even sunscreen are oil free - Complex 15 is oil free moisturizer that helps avoid dry skin - Get in the habit of using oil-free lotions - Get rid of hair chemicals such as gels or hair cream - Always watch for labels with the term non-comedogenic, which means they don't cause pores to be clogged 4. Proven Chemicals Benzoyl Peroxide This eliminates the bacteria that worsens acne and it also unplugs oil secretions and helps pimples or acne to heal. This can be found in many over-the-counter acne treatments. Start traditionalistically with a five percent moisturizer once everyday like after washing the face before going to bed. After a week, make it twice everyday if there are no other medications being taken or used. If the acne is not yet healed after four to six weeks, try a ten per cent mixture. This can be bought over-the-counter, however, there is a need to seek for a doctor's prescription. Just be sure to request for a real form the pharmacist can be asked which can be bought over-the-counter or which needs prescription. Antibiotics These are available only if there's a doctor's recommendation. Antibiotics are very helpful aid for pimples or acne that is already swelling and red and usually have pus, or for if it not those not anymore being treated with medications as expected. These antibiotics eliminate the bacteria, which develop to whiteheads. Make it a point to follow the doctor's recommended dosage and always take the antibiotic pills with enough amount of water. Some of these bacteria killing medicines may also increase the skin's sensitivity to the sun, for this use sunscreen when going out to prevent any sunburn. Accutane Accutane are antibiotics that are available only under a doctor's order and recommendation. Accutane is a very optimized pill that is intended for those with deep scars, or pimples that can no longer be treated by other medications or antibiotics. Blood test is taken every now and then when using Accutane as medication, as this can affect the levels blood cell and blood count. For women, the physician, possibly an obstetrician-gynecologist may require the intake of birth control pills prior to prescribing the Accutane. Extra caution is really taken into consideration, as it can be very harmful to to pregnant women. However, until this time some physicians are not prescribing Accutane. 5. Treatment Information The Treatment can take some time which often takes six to eight weeks for the pimple to heal after there will be another start of treatment. Some medications can cause acne to get even bigger or redder before it gets well, there are times when these could have pus too. If the acne still has not welled after several medications with other drugs, the doctor may suggest that the patient take an oral medicine. Doctors recommend this retinoid as a last treatment, due to its serious effects and it is also very expensive. Sometimes women are asked to take birth control pills as to help them control acne especially in women who mood swings even before their menstruations start. "},{"title":" Treat Acne With Essential Fatty Acids ","word_count":700,"summary":" Learn about the relationship between essential fatty acids and skin health. Learn which essential fatty acid deficiecy could be involved in acne, and why essential fatty acids in general are beneficial for acne sufferers. ","keywords":" essential fatty acids and acne, natural acne treatments, acne, essential fatty acids ","article_body":" Whilst scientists do not fully understand the cause of acne, the role of essential fatty acids in the body, including the skin, is reasonably understood. This understanding has led to some scientists and natural health practitioners looking at the effects and benefits of essential fatty acids for skin conditions such as acne. Udo Erasmus is a writer with post graduate studies in genetics, and biochemistry, and a PhD in Nutrition. He believes there are nutritional deficiencies and problems that can cause or exacerbate acne, though they are not as simple as the usual ones about chocolate! Central to his belief is that \"Hard fats and (hard) protein debris clog narrow pores and channels in our skin, and invite infection by bacteria who feast on the mess\". (p346) He believes acne is a result of \"fatty degeneration\". Factors in this are * fats associating poorly with protein * too many 'hard' fats * not enough essential fatty acids Hard fats are also called saturated fatty acids. These are the fats that are found in most food, including animal fats and dairy.  Their name comes from the fact that the fat molecules carry the maximum amount of hydrogen molecules that they possibly can. This has significance in the way these fats act in our body. Some of these saturated fats have a high melting point, like butter and milk fat. An excess can cause problems for our arteries and heart health. Fatty acids, of the essential and non essential kind, are found in our cell membranes. This includes the membranes of the skin. Erasmus describes the characteristics of saturated fatty acids as tending to stick together. And because they have a higher melting point, they are more likely to be clump together and form deposits when we consume them in excess. So, they are harder for the body to get rid of. And as well as clumping together, they can clump with other things like protein, minerals, and cholesterol. Excess sugar can be a problem because our body converts excess sugar into saturated fatty acids. Other problems with excess saturated fatty acids includes the fact that the body can convert them into unsaturated fatty acids, which can then oxidize if we don't consume enough fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids can reduce the supply of oxygen to our tissues, by making blood cells which carry oxygen stick together and so impede that vital transportation system which normally carries oxygen to our cells. Excess fat, including excess saturated fats, are stored in the adipose cells in our skin. These are fat storage centers. Erasmus recommends consuming W3 (alpha linolenic acid) and w6 (flax and linoleic acid) essential fatty acids in the correct ratio. Essential fatty acids have free receptors for hydrogen bonds. This characteristic changes the way the molecules are structured in terms of the shape they have. And it is this different shape, a kinked shape, that means they don't clump together with the affinity that saturated fats do. And they also have a lower melting point - so they are more liquid also. Because of this difference in structure, they also have a slight negative molecular charge, and given that like charges repel, this is another reason why they don't clump together. Erasmus characterizes these properties of unsaturated fats as providing 'fluidity' to cell membranes. He says this allows the cells to fulfill important chemical functions. Inflammation, a characteristic of acne, is associated with a deficiency in the essential fatty acid LNA, or alpha linolenic acid. Erasmus writes that whilst inflammation is not a classical symptom of LNA, when people take alpha linolenic acid supplements, this symptom can be reversed. Essential fatty acids as a group are strongly anti-inflammatory. Another essential fatty acid, linoleic acid (LA) has particular reference to acne. When there is a deficiency of linoleic acid, the oil producing glands in the skin make sebum that is mixed with oleic acid. Oleic acid is found in butter and land animal fats. However, in excess, it can interfere in essential fatty acid use. But more importantly for acne sufferers, sebum mixed with oleic acid is irritating to the skin. It lends itself to blockages of the pores that result in acne, blackheads and whiteheads.

There are various ways of reducing the occurrence of acne. Make up should not be done. Wash your face with mild soap and water to remove the plugs on the skin pore, which is a combination of dead skin cells, bacteria and hardened sebum. Dirt increases the infection by interacting with skin debris and extra oil in the skin. Use topical cleansing pads containing salicylic acid, sulfur and benzoyl peroxide to remove excess oil. You can even try washing your face with the hottest water you can withstand. Minimize the se of harsh cleansers and try to use acne skin care items that exfoliate mildly. Avoid scrubbing the affected area vigorously. Do not touch your face with dirty hands. Hen the weather is hot and you are perspiring, tie up your hair to keep it away from falling on your face. Pimples should not be pinched, squeezed or picked. This causes it to become red and inflamed and spreads bacteria. Apply ice packs to the pimple for 2 minutes after every 30 minutes. It helps to reduce the pain and swelling. If needed to wear makeup, wear oil-free makeup. Cleanse your skin with an acne-fighting medicine to remove oil, dirt and makeup. A dab of toothpaste on the affected area before going to bed can soothe irritation and redness. Pressing a wet tea bag or a cotton ball, with a dab of lemon juice against the blemish for five minutes helps to reduce swelling and redness. Clearing your face of acne does not always help as it sometimes leaves a scar behind. There are various acne scar removal techniques involving natural and chemical products.

Of these there are basically 3 levels Minor, superficial peels - lactic, glycolic, salicylic. Medium depth peels - TCA, Jessner's Deep peels - phenol. We will only deal with medium strength TCA peels here as they are the easiest to apply (Jessner's can require multiple concurrent applications and taping to aide in skin penetration), safest, and, by far, the most effective against numerous skin ailments/conditions. They are also one of the most effective treatments for acne currently known to the medical community. The most common treated area is the face. TCA is applied usually in a cream. Doctors will mix Obagi, Apeel, or other previously prepared cream with TCA and then apply this mixture to the face or body area to be treated. The creams tend to have a skin dye of green or blue so the doctor can easily see what areas have and or have not been treated. It is usually applied with a cotton or foam applicator. This is then left on for 10-20 minutes. Some doctors prefer to use a straight (non-cream) solution of TCA. This works much faster and penetrates deeper and is used for deeper peels. After application and proper time for the desired depth is achieved, the doctor will apply a neutralizer. This is usually just a mixture of baking soda and water made into a paste. Some doctors will add chipped ice to further cool the skin. The skin will now be inflammed and if no dye was used will look like a bad sunburn. This will last 2-4 days until it starts to peel off and reveal new, clean, younger looking skin. Depending on the skin problems treated it may take several treatments, but a major difference will be seen immediately. The results from a TCA peel are far more reaching than with a regular, superficial peel. Results can last 6 months to a year and it has been known to keep acne at bay, shrink and lessen acne scars, reduce and tighten up wrinkles, improve color, pigmentation, etc... A TCA peel cannot be applied as often as a more superficial peel. Generally speaking, a superficial peel can be applied every 2-5 weeks. A Stronger, medium depth peel needs more time batween peels for the skin to properly heal and regenerate. Doctors like to wait 2-6 months or more between these peels. This process of chemically exfoliating the skin is more rapid and deeper in a TCA peel than in most peels. Many skin peels, like lactic, glycolic and salicylic are good at reducing oily buildup (overactive sebaceous glands), and very minor skin imperfections. but they cannot effectively treat acne, wrinkles, fine lines, etc... TCA has been proven to treat these deeper skin conditions and is offered at almost every dermatologist and plastic surgeon office. The improvement in skin color, tone, etc... is so drastic that women, even men are lining up in droves to have this done all over the world.

Most worrying is recent reports that the side effects may continue after the treatment has stopped. However, many people could treat their acne without taking these risks. Treating and Preventing Acne Holistically Acne can be treated and prevented safely naturally.  A good starting point is a regular skincare routine using natural products manufactured with sensitive skin in mind. Although initially it would seem a good idea to use harsh face washes that strip the sebum from the skin, in reality this often results in the sebaceous gland overcompensating and generating even more sebum. By using gentle, natural skincare products we can clean the pores without upsetting the balance of sebum production. Many natural products also contain mild antibacterial ingredients that are an added bonus. A good skincare routine will include washing, toning and moisturising the skin on your face daily and then using a mask to draw out impurities once or twice a week. Mild and Moderate Acne Clinical studies show that blue light and red light, working at specific wavelengths, act together in clearing mild to moderate acne. The blue light has an antibacterial effect whilst the red light acts as an effective anti-inflammatory.*9 *10 This technology is now available for home use with the Beauty Skin light box. Used for just 15 minutes a day, the Beauty Skin offers a safe effective treatment for acne that has been shown to produce results in just 4 weeks. Diet and Acne Contrary to popular belief, there is evidence linking our diets to acne. There are people who refute the link, but they cite studies that have involved diets only maintained for seven days. Few acne treatments, conventional or otherwise, would be entirely successful in that short period of time. Indeed research*1 with people suffering from acne has shown that a diet needs to be maintained for six weeks before the body shows the required increase in vitamins levels to help acne. Further research shows the blood analysed from patients with severe acne has considerably worse levels of vitamins A and E than blood analysed from patients  with mild acne*3. This seems to suggest a clear link between deficiency in those vitamins and acne. Thus eating foods high in those nutrients would be beneficial. Minerals are also very important, research has shown both Zinc*5, and selenium*6 are beneficial in helping to reduce acne. The best method of increasing intake of these vitamins and minerals is via a diet high in vegetables and fruit which lasts at least 6 weeks. A good way to ensure a high intake of these vitamins is to include combinations of freshly juiced  blackberries, kiwi fruit, watercress,  Swiss chard, cranberries, mango, apricots for vitamin E and broccoli, spinach, kale, carrots, Green lettuce, spinach, watercress, Apricots, peaches, mango, loquats, passion fruit, grapefruit  for vitamin A. Please note that it is possible to have too much vitamin A, see notice at the end of the article. Moderation is the key! If there is evidence concerning the foods we should be eating, what evidence is there concerning the foods we should avoid? There is evidence linking milk consumption and acne*2 so removing or at least reducing milk from your diet would be wise. There also seems to be evidence, although only empirical, that links refined carbohydrates, sugars and acne. Although scientists and doctors have yet to establish the exact nature of the link, it is believed be due to the body requiring more chromium to deal with the high blood sugar caused by these food types. This is based on studies that found people with unstable blood sugar levels suffered a high incidence of acne, but when chromium supplements were given the acne rapidly improved *7. We do know and accept that there are some countries whose populations have diets consisting of fresh fruit, vegetables, lean meats and fish, and are generally free of acne*4.  We also know that when these people move to a country whose diet is high in processed foods, dairy and refined sugars, many begin to suffer from acne. Many people dismiss this as only empirical evidence but if you want to effectively treat acne the correlation would be an important point to note and incorporate into your daily diet. Conclusion So acne can be treated, and more importantly prevented, naturally without risks of the side effects that many of the conventional drugs incur. A gentle skin care routine and a diet low in processed food and high in unprocessed food for at least 6 weeks should see a vast improvement in your acne and general skin condition. For more stubborn cases, or faster results, combine the routine with Beauty Skin treatments for the ultimate acne free skin care routine. IMPORTANT NOTICE Vitamin A in doses of 25,000iu or higher can be extremely dangerous.. As a guide there is around 15,500IU/100g of Vitamin A in Kale and 16,812 IU/100g in carrots.

It is also excellent for those with cystic acne and asphyxiated skin. The warmth, moisture and fragrance of herbal steam melts away muscular tensions, clears the mind and lifts the spirit. You may wonder what this has got to do with the cystic acne. Steams are one of the oldest traditional ways of deep-cleansing the skin. The moisture softens the dry outer edges of the skin, making them easier to remove, leaving behind a soothing and fresher complexion. The heat boosts facial circulation and activates the pores and glands which brings dirt and body toxins to the surface. All said and done, let us take it that everyone is not blessed with smooth, glowing and healthy skin. But, we have to carry on with the available skin and look after it by giving it the importance it deserves. The skin is the final protection for your body and so it is your duty to protect its health and well-being, by understanding its present condition properly.

Whiteheads or blackheads will have to be treated with a cool head! No doubt, acne on the face is bound to cause a confusing contour in the curtain of your mind, but desperate remedies are not the solutions for desperate situations. A basic understanding of the acne situation in each individual case requires a thorough study. Fortunately or unfortunately, the literature and expertise regarding the treatment options available are likely to be confounded! A mountain of literature about the molehill that is acne! Let it be perfectly understood that total cure of acne is an impossibility. If someone, some product or some company- national or multinational promises it, take it as a business advertisement! They dwell upon it, because they have to sell. And all the selling is done at somebody's cost! If the golden rule, an ounce of prevention is better than a cure, is to be applied anywhere, apply it here; and apply it with profit. What is your basic formula for skin care? If it is no new spots, improved skin condition and making efforts to deny future scarring, you are on the right track! You have understood your acne! Personal treatment for a universal disease! Human skin needs a certain amount of oil to maintain its natural condition. And when it comes to acne skin, skin care becomes even more important. Keep the spot-prone areas clean. Wash the affected area twice a day with a perfume free cleanser. Note that aggressive washing and strong soaps are big enemies of your acne skin. Plus, hundreds of over-the-counter remedies are available with your chemist. The anti-bacterial agents in them, like benzoyl peroxide will help you a great deal to defeat acne. The skin areas where you feel that the spot is likely to emerge, must be kept clean. In effect, these agents dry out the skin and encourage it to shed the surface layer of dead skin. These effects make it harder for pores to become blocked and infection does not spread. When the antibacterial effects dry out the skin, the surface layer of the skin begins to fall. The pores are not blocked and infection is checked. No treatment will tender on the spot results. Significant effects, if they materialize hopefully, will take their own time. If results are not forthcoming, say within a period of two months, then it the time to switch over the treatment after consulting a dermatologist. At this stage, he has many options depending upon your case-history and his understanding of the problem, after certain investigations, if necessary. He has an armory of treatment options- both for external application and internal consumption. And finally, do not fail to consult your Grandma!

","keywords":" acne. acnes, faqs, faq, FAQ, FAQS, ACNE, ACNES ","article_body":" It's important to know that there is no true cure for acne. If untreated, it can last for many years, although acne usually clears up as you get older. The following treatments, however, generally can keep acne under control. 1. Use topical benzoyl peroxide lotion or gel Benzoyl peroxide helps kill skin bacteria, unplug the oil ducts and heal acne pimples. It is the most effective acne treatment you can get without a doctor's prescription. Many brands are available in different levels of strength (2.5 percent, 5 percent or 10 percent). Read the labels or ask your pediatrician or pharmacist about it. * Start slowly with a 2.5 percent or 5 percent lotion or gel once a day. After a week, increase use to twice a day (morning and night) if your skin isn't too red or isn't peeling. * Apply a thin film to the entire area where pimples may occur. Don't just dab it on current blemishes. Avoid the delicate skin around the eyes, mouth and corner of the nose. * If your acne isn't better after four to six weeks, you may increase to a 10 percent strength lotion or gel. Start with one application each day and increase to two daily applications if your skin tolerates it. 2. If you don't see results, consult your pediatrician Your doctor can prescribe stronger treatments, if needed, and will teach you how to use them properly. Three kinds of medications may be recommended * TRETINOIN (RETIN-A) CREAM OR GEL helps unplug oil ducts but must be used exactly as directed. Be aware that exposure to the sun (or tanning parlors) can cause increased redness in some people who are using the medication. * TOPICAL ANTIBIOTIC SOLUTIONS may be used in addition to other medications for a type of acne called pustular acne. * ORAL ANTIBIOTIC PILLS may be used in addition to creams, lotions or gels if your acne doesn't respond to topical treatments alone. 3. What about the \"miracle drug\" Accutane? Isotretinoin (Accutane) is a very strong chemical taken in pill form. It is used only for severe cystic acne that hasn't responded to any other treatment. Accutane must NEVER be taken just before or during pregnancy. There is a danger of severe or even fatal deformities to unborn babies whose mothers have taken Accutane while pregnant or who become pregnant soon after taking Accutane. You should never have unprotected sexual intercourse while taking Accutane. Patients who take Accutane must be carefully supervised by a doctor knowledgeable about its usage, such as a pediatric dermatologist or other expert on treating acne. Your pediatrician may require a negative pregnancy test and a signed consent form before prescribing Accutane to females. If you are experiencing acne problems, remember that your pediatrician can help you. And as you begin treatment, keep these helpful tips in mind * Be patient. It takes three to six weeks to see any improvement. Give each treatment enough time to work. * Be faithful. Follow your program every day. Don't stop and start each time your skin changes. Remember, sometimes your skin may appear to worsen early in the program before you begin to see improvement. * Follow directions. Not using the treatment as directed is the most common reason the treatment fails. * Don't use medication prescribed for someone else. This holds true for all medications, especially Accutane. Doctors prescribe medication specifically for particular patients. What's good for a friend may be harmful for you. Never take Accutane that's prescribed for another person. * Don't overdo it. Too much scrubbing makes skin worse. Too much benzoyl peroxide or Retin-A cream makes your face red and scaly. Too much oral antibiotic may cause side effects.

Including information to help identify them. ","keywords":" acne, acne control, acne treatment ","article_body":" Acne comes in many forms. Although most commonly found on the face, acne ranges from Mild to Severe and can be located anywhere on the body. Most frequently self-treated, mild cases are manageable. However, severe cases should be treated under the supervision of health professionals, such as dermatologists. Acne Vulgaris, translated as 'common acne,' is the most common type of acne. It is better known as blackheads, whiteheads, papules, pustules, nodules or cysts. Blackheads - Occur in partially blocked pores. Dead skin cells, bacteria, and sebum (the substance that causes oily skin) drain to the surface of the skin; the pigments are exposed to air, which causes the black color. Blackheads can take a long time to clear up. Whiteheads - Contained beneath the surface of the skin, the trapped sebum, dead cells and bacteria are completely blocked in the pores. Pustules - With the appearance of a red circle with a white or yellow center, this form of acne is more often called Pimples or Zits. Nodules - Much larger than other forms of acne, nodules form hard lumps beneath the surface of the skin which can be painful and last for several months. Highly susceptible to scarring, this form of acne is recommended to be treated by a dermatologist. Cysts - Similar to a nodule, this form of acne is filled with pus. Like nodules, cysts can be very painful and lead to scarring if untreated. Cysts should be treated by a dermatologist. Acne Conglobata - More common in males than females, this rare form of acne vulgaris is extremely disfiguring. Large lesions form on the face, chest, back, buttocks, upper arms, and thighs, sometimes accompanied by numerous blackheads. Acne Conglobata can cause severe psychological as well as physical suffering, damage to the skin and permanent scarring. This condition can last several years. Acne Fulminans - A sudden case of Acne Conglobata, with a fever and aching joints. Generally treated with oral steroids. Gram-Negative Folliculitis - A bacterial infection which causes pustules and cysts, this form of acne may be caused by long-term treatment of acne with antibiotics. Pyoderma Faciale - Affecting only females usually between ages 20 and 40, most commonly in women who never had acne before, this type of acne consists of painful pustules, cysts and nodules on the face. Permanent scarring is potential. Generally clears up within a year. Acne Rosacea - Notably affecting people over the age of 30, Acne Rosacea causes a red rash on the face. Pimples or other skin blemishes may also be present. This should not be confused with Acne Vulgaris as there are two different treatments for these types. Acne Rosacea occurs more frequently in women than men but is more severe in the men it affects.

Knowing what type of skin you have is the first step to effectively controlling your acne. ","keywords":" Skin Care, Acne, Acne Treatment, Dermatology, Beauty, Face, ","article_body":" Treating your acne can be an overwhelming task what with all of the medications available these days. The best way to find treatment for your acne is to first learn about your skin. There are 3 main skin types. Knowing what type of skin you have is the first step to effectively controlling your acne. If your skin is oily a gel product is best; if it is dry, you should choose a cream based product. People with sensitive skin should choose products with lower concentrations of active ingredients. It may be best to visit a dermatologist when choosing acne treatments. With so many different factors affecting what causes acne and there are so many treatments to choose from you may feel more comfortable getting the help of a professional when making your decision. If you would rather control acne your own way, understand that it is very important to read all labels and always, always use as directed. As with all medications, educate yourself on any side-effects or warnings. Acne treatments are available in several different ways including - Prescription Medications - Creams and Gels - Facial Masks - Topical Treatments - Over-the-Counter Treatments - Home Remedies Prescription Medications Oral antibiotics (tablets), taken daily for around 3 months, can be prescribed for inflammatory acne. These pills act to kill off the bacteria infecting the skin. However, it may take four to six months for the benefits to be seen. For women, a standard combined oral contraceptive pill (containing an estrogen and a progestogen) can improve acne symptoms. Antibiotics do not prevent pores from becoming blocked so treatment to prevent blackheads, such as benzoyl peroxide, is often also prescribed at the same time. Creams and Gels Lotions that contain benzoyl peroxide dry out the skin and encourage it to shed the surface layer of dead skin. Benzoyl peroxide also has an antibacterial action. Together, these effects make it harder for pores to become blocked and for infection to develop. When used as directed, these products can make a big difference to the overall appearance of your skin. Facial Masks Facial masks can be a great addition to your basic skin care regimen by offering extra deep cleaning and exfoliation to troubled skin. Masks send a concentrated dose of proven acne fighters to your skin and deliver them deep down. A good facial mask can act to keep even the most troubled skin clean and clear, reducing the frequency and severity of breakouts. There are several benefits of using clay masks. As a facial clay mask dries it tightens the skin, shrinks the pores and naturally pulls excess oils and impurities such as whiteheads and blackheads from your skin. Topical Treatments Topical antibiotics work by killing the Propionibacterium acnes bacteria. This helps reduce the small infections in the pores, and also indirectly keeps the pores open. Over the counter Treatments Over-the-counter remedies are available anywhere from your local pharmacy to the grocery store and are intended to treat mild to moderate acne. These treatments include the creams and gels mentioned previously. Home treatment It's important to keep spot-prone areas clean, so wash the affected area twice a day with an un-perfumed cleanser. Never, ever pick a zit! This could lead to scarring as well as spread the infection. No home treatments for acne will work immediately. It can take weeks, if not months, for significant effects to be noticeable. Never sleep in makeup and wash your face in the morning when you wake up and at night before you go to bed.

Mornings of anguish in the discovery of a red throbbing acne on the face is something every person has experienced in their lives. While this may seem a disaster to some, others can take it just for what it is and calmly treat the acne to get rid of it. Acne is different from the common pimple because it could leave a permanent scar in your face, neck or back. This is how acne grows when your skin pore starts to clog due to greasy oil and toxins, it starts to get inflamed. If left untreated, It could develop into an infection which could damage further the affected parts. It is evident on teenagers and young adults because they are reaching the puberty stage of life, where the levels of hormones causes some changes in the skin gland size, which causes larger amount of oil secretion produced by these glands, resulting to acne. Now, if your face does have mild acne, a minor treatment is enough to take care of it. Washing your face with mild soap and water is enough to free your skin pores from these oils, but other effective alternatives such as lukewarm water with dissolved salt is also recommended. Whenever you will use acne medications, be sure it is water-based; oil-based products tend to stimulate oil glands to produce more oil rather than controlling it. If you have a severe condition of acne attacks, get medical assistance from a physician or a skin specialist. They can issue prescriptions of antibiotics to control spreading of acne and prevent the scarring on your face and other affected parts. Acne is regarded as a teenager's problem, but adult acne does happen as well. Many individuals above their twenties have had recurring problems with acne. This could be blamed on stress, overactive glands and eating oily foods. A dermatologist would be able to help you out if the acne persists, but keeping a clean, oil-free face, neck and back can certainly help a lot.

The source of this shock and disappointment is an inflamed greasy and oily clogged up skin pore. Acne is an unwelcome blemish on anyone's face; it can be quite painful too.  If left untreated, acne can leave an unpleasant scar on the face, neck or back. Unlike the common pimple, acne can be inflamed and possibly turn out to be infected. Hormones that go into overdrive during the teen years of a person cause acne, they produce an excess of oil deposits in the glands resulting to this skin blemish. While they are not particularly life threatening or are they extremely painful and disturbing they can leave permanent scars in the affected area. Acne usually happens around the teenage years, from 13 to 19, and usually disappears there after. Different people have different levels or seriousness of acne infection. These will all depend on the amount of oils and dirt the face has. While some have minor infections that can be treated by simply washing the affected area, there are those that necessitate the consultation of a dermatologist or a skin expert. Acne may not seem to be a serious matter for some, but it is an infection that can greatly affect many. There are people with acne who locks themselves up in their rooms waiting for the acne to disappear. It is a serious blemish that they cannot show to the world. Every year, ointments and acne medication has estimated sales of over a hundred million dollars. This just shows how many people are dead serious in eliminating acne.

","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" Puberty acne develops from a few simple steps. First, teenage acne occurs when for some unknown reason or combination of reasons, hair follicles, also known as pores, become blocked. Although the exact combination of reasons that pores become clogged may not be fully known, many contributing elements for teenagers and adults alike can include * genetics (whether or not there is a history of acne problems and if so, to what extent) * hormones * dietary and vitamin make up (or lack of /deficiency) * stress related factors Other denominators in the development of puberty acne could include factors like how your body normally rids itself of its dead skin cells. And influences that may be working against this regularity. For example, climate and other environmental factors, overall body health at the time of the outbreak, and your hormones and their effect on your own body's sebum production (especially for females). Second, the normal dead skin cells that combine with your body's natural sebum oil as it drains through the skin's surface become clogged in these blocked pores. This substance becomes somewhat sticky, further clogging the passageway. Third, bacteria begins to grow around these clogged areas. As a normal reaction, your body's white blood cells attack the bacteria, fighting it and pushing it out of the body. And forth, the resulting growths during this 14-day to 21-day battle are called microcomedones. Microcomedones turn into comedones, commonly referred to as blemishes, pimples or acne. There are basically four types of puberty acne whiteheads, blackheads, pimples and nodules. Whiteheads are when the sebum (oil) and resulting bacteria are trapped below the skin's surface and you can actually see a white head appear above (or near popping out of) the skin. Blackheads are when the sebum and resulting bacteria are only partially trapped, slowly draining out the surface and turning black because of your skin's melanin or pigmentation. In the absence of either white or blackhead are generally (but not always) smaller pimples. And the often deeper, boil-like lesions are referred to as nodules. All forms of puberty acne can be mild, moderate or severe. Typically, mild puberty acne is visible in the form of whiteheads and blackheads, sometimes pimples. With moderate puberty acne, more pimples and pustules are present on the face, some may appear on the back or chest. And with severe puberty acne, many nodules develop, often large and sore, over parts of the face, back, chest and other body areas. This type of acne can lead to scarring. Actually, lesser cases of puberty acne have been followed by scarring. So for those with possible nodular acne, seeking advice from a healthcare provider as soon as possible is recommended. A gender issue to note is that males more often have the severe form of acne rather than females, due to their hormones. And the areas where they tend to break out most frequently are unfortunately more difficult to treat, the chest and back.

They are like the episodes of a TV serial. Some stage of the story is covered in every episode, and a deliberate suspense is created at the ending. Here, the dermatologist may not deliberately try to keep you in suspense, but after completion of every stage, it is natural for you to have your quota of suspense, “Will this scar fully heal?” There is no doubt that innovative skin care technology for acne, bums, surgery and piercing has arrived. The dermatologist will give you tens of reasons to get beautiful, getting rid of scars. He has documents of many success stories. You arrived at his clinic  with scar-removal temptation, and your temptation is now confirmed. He has explained to you doubt-proof methods to reduce and eliminate acne scars. Acne scars can affect anyone. After the healing process, the skin is left with a discoloration that may take months to heal. 6 to 18 months is the normal estimate. If the scar still persists, and is in no mood to go, then surgical methods are the only alternative. Since the scars are visible, they cause embarrassment. There is nothing to worry about the macules of “pseduo-scars”. When it eventually disappears in the natural processing of healing, it leaves no trace. Post-inflammatory pigmentation is discoloration of the skin at the site of a healed acne lesion, which may last up to 18 months. Chemical peeling is likely to hasten the disappearance of post-inflammatory healing process. It is better to bear the scars if they are not in the visible part of the body. It is difficult to predict how successfully scars can be treated. For, the healing duration differs from case to case. Acne scars are generally categorized in two types (a) scars caused by increased tissue formation and (b) scars caused by the loss of tissue. The decision to seek surgical treatment is an important one. The type of treatment has to suit you best. The experience and expertise of the dermatologist come to play an important part here. He may fail sometimes, at your cost, despite of his best efforts. You have to make your personal decision whether to live in the company of your scar/s,unless it is a psychological burden for you. Scar treatment usually improves the appearance of the skin. But if your expectation is total restoration, it is an impossibility. The main aim of any acne scar treatment is basically to provide you a totally acceptable look. To have a complete restoration of your previous look is far than a possibility.

Indeed, when a person is afflicted with body acne, that men or woman -- or young person -- aches for relief from the condition that cause an itchy sensation in the best case scenario and pain in the worst of all situations. Left without proper and effective treatment, body acne can actually end up festering and causing infection and ultimately permanent damage to the skin in the form of irreversible scarring. Therefore, if you are a person who is experiencing the early stages of body acne or if you are in the midst of a full blown body acne outbreak, it is imperative that you undertake a proper course of treatment. Primary Causes of Body Acne In many instances, there is not a solitary or primary cause for a body acne condition or outbreak. Rather, in many cases, a body acne outbreak is the result of a combination of factors -- an acne perfect storm, if you will. One significant contributing factor to an outbreak of body acne is a lack of effective cleansing. By this it is not meant that a person fails to bathe. Rather, what is meant that in such a circumstance a person fails to utilize the right types of cleansing and body washing products that can work effectively to keep the skin clean as well as free from dead cell and oil buildup. Choice of fabrics can also be a contributing factor to body acne in some instances. Many people who are experiencing what is in fact a body acne outbreak assume that they are having some sort of more routine allergic reaction to a certain type of material. While on some level this is true, an outbreak of body acne due to a reaction to a certain type of fabric requires a different type of treatment regimen than what would normally be associated with caring for a rash that is the result of an allergic reaction. In some instances a person’s diet can contribute to an outbreak of body acne. There is a significant amount of dispute as to which types of food items might be a contributing cause to body acne. In the final analysis, the best way to avoid having your diet contribute to an outbreak of body acne is to make the best possible effort to eat a well balanced diet each and every day. A final common contributing cause to body acne in some cases is the bed linen a person uses at night. In this regard, some people are a bit lax when it comes to caring and laundering their bed linens. As a result, bodily oils and dead skin cells can accumulate on bed linens leading to an outbreak of body acne across a person’s skin in some instances. Once again, you need to keep in mind that in most instances there likely is to be more than one contributing factor in the outbreak of body acne. Treating Your Body Acne Condition The best course of action to take in the care and treatment of body acne is to develop and adopt a comprehensive treatment regimen. When it comes to body acne, an appropriate, complete care and treatment regimen should include -- the elimination or adjustment of the root causes of the body acne condition (for example, diet changes, clothing fabric alterations and a change in body cleansing products) -- the adoption of whole body cleansing practices with soaps and washes designed to combat and prevent body acne -- the adoption of a whole body exfoliation routine -- the use of body acne treatment and cleansing products such as ZENMED™ Body Acne Combo Because body acne can have a number of different sources, launching a full frontal attack on the problem as described in this article will be the best source to resolving the condition in the near future. In addition, by adopting a comprehensive regimen that includes the use of such proven products as ZENMED™ Body Acne Combo, you will be in a far better position to prevent future body acne outbreaks. (If you don’t completely eliminate future outbreaks, you will at least be able to effectively reduce the severity of such future body acne outbreaks.) Conclusion The care and treatment of body acne is something that you must take seriously. If you fail to adopt a comprehensive care and treatment regimen, you will fail in your attempts to treat and eliminate body acne. On the other hand, if you do adopt a truly comprehensive body acne care and treatment regimen, you not only will be able to deal with a present flare-up but you will be well on your way to preventing future outbreaks of body acne in both the near and long term future.

Understanding what cystic acne is can help you to better treat this condition on your own body. For many individuals, it is traumatizing in the way that their outward appearance is flawed by these small but powerful infections. The skin becomes inflamed here and it may even hurt. The irritants are likely to be bacteria as well as a combination of other factors. The bottom line is, though, that people want and need results when it comes to treating cystic acne. What Causes It? Cystic acne is caused by when the oil ducts in the skin become clogged. This will lead to the ducts (or pores) becoming infected. The oil ducts are over producing oils that are generally need to help keep the skin moist as well as to help the hair follicle to ease out of the skin. Yet, for many teenagers, hormones are all out of control and this can cause these oil glands to simply produce too much oil. Eventually, bacteria find there way into this area and irritate it enough to cause the infection on the skin. This is what cystic acne is. Treatments For It While the causes of cystic acne are important, the treatments for it are just as important to those that are suffering from it. Many individuals, mostly teenagers will deal with this type of acne for at least several years of their life if they do have the right conditions for it. But, the good news is that there are acne treatments that really can work and work well for them. The best acne treatments are those that provide for all aspects of the condition. 1. They should treat the bacteria that are infecting the skin. 2. They should stop or slow down the production of oils through either destroying oil glands or through controlling hormone levels. 3. They should protect the face from new infections forming through methods such as cleansing and exfoliation. Acne products are available that can do any and all of these things. If you are like most, you’ll want to get started on it right away. Start with natural acne products and then work on the acne treatments that are not working. You will soon see that cystic acne can respond to medication and treatment. "},{"title":" Understanding The Different Types Of Acne ","word_count":464,"summary":" Before you can treat your acne, it may be to your benefit to understand that there are different types of acne.  You should have a better understanding of your acne after reading this article. ","keywords":" acne, pimples, ","article_body":" Though all pimples form the same way, they often take on different shapes and characteristics, and react differently on different people.  Acne is formed when a hair follicle becomes clogged and what is called a comedo is formed.  As the follicle becomes clogged with more oil, the comedo becomes larger, inflaming the skin around the area and forming what we know of as a pimple.  There are several types of acne, each requiring different methods of treatment.  This article covers some of those types, explaining each and making treatment suggestions. Non-inflammatory acne often takes the form of a closed comedo, or whitehead.  This occurs when the plugged hair follicle  stays beneath the surface of the skin, and appears on the skin as a small whiteish bump. An open comedo, or blackhead, occurs when the plug enlarges and pushes through the surface of the skin.  Its dark appearance is not due to dirt, but rather to a build up of the dark pigment of the skin called melanin.  Blackheads are also a type of inflammatory acne. The mildest form of inflammatory acne is a papule, a small, firm, pink bump appearing on the surface of the skin.  These bumps can be tender to the touch, and are often considered an intermediary step between non-inflammatory and inflammatory acne. Pustules are like papules in that they are small, round lesions.  Unlike papules, pustules are clearly inflamed and visibly contain pus.  They may appear red at the base with a yellowish or whiteish center. Pustules do not generally contain a great deal of bacteria, but are inflamed due to chemical irritation from sebum components. Nodular or cystic acne is usually very painful.  Nodules are inflamed pus-filled lesions lodged deep within the skin.  They develop when the contents of a comedo has spilled into the surrounding skin and immune system responds, producing pus.  The most severe form of this type of acne may persist for weeks or even months, eventually hardening into a cyst.  Both nodules and cysts often leave deep scars. Acne conglobata, a rare form of inflammatory acne, forms primarily on the back, buttocks, and chest.  It is characterized by pustules and nodules, and severe bacterial infection may ensue. Acne cosmetica is a relatively mild form of acne caused from topical cosmetic products.  It is characterized by small pink bumps, and local inflammation on the cheek, chin, and forehead.  It may develop over the course of a few weeks or months, but usually does not cause scarring.  Since it can persist indefinitely, it is important to find out which topical products are causing the problem and eliminate their use. It is important to understand what is causing your acne so a suitable treatment can be found.  Before you can solve the problem, you must know its origin.

Sometimes, there are overworked oil glands which enlarge and produce too much sebum which can get trapped in the hair follicle. Thus the pores will get clogged which are either called blackheads or whiteheads, allow bacteria overgrowth of Propionibacterium acnes. In the surrounding skin, acne will be formed by inflaming the hair follicle by this bacterium. Acne control Including a variety of seeds, nuts, vegetables and fresh fruit in your diet can be a good control for acne. Drink plenty of water every day since dehydrated skin sheds dead cells which can lead to clogged pores and effective acne control. Most skin care products contain chemical ingredients that can aggravate acne. If you use make-up, try products that are non-comedogenic. Keeping stress levels low can also reduce the release of stress hormones and reduce the intensity of acne. Dairy products and red meat in your diet can cause acne. Heavily tanned skin can lead to blocked pores. Some of the acne control guidelines recommended by The American Academy of Dermatology are as follows. •\tDo not squeeze, pop or pick at the acne lesion. This can spread the inflammatory process and worsen the acne. •\tWash your face twice a day gently with mild soap or sulfur soap. Just pat your face dry and do not rub it with a towel. •\tAvoid oil based products. •\tAvoid acne irritants such as airborne grease from fast food restaurants, rubbing or friction from sporting equipment etc. •\tGive anti-acne products time to clear up the lesions. This can mean several weeks or even months. •\tSome acne products increase the skin's photosensitivity. When in the sun wear a hat and use sunscreen and avoid tanning booths while using these products. Acne Cleanser Acne Cleansers have an important part in skin care. A good acne cleanser will remove make-up, oil build up, dirt and other debris from the skin's surface, preparing it for acne fighting treatments.

Vilantae stops acne at it's source, has no negative side effects, and does not require a prescription. ","keywords":" Acne, Acne Treatment, B5, Accutane, Vitamins ","article_body":" There are two very effective ways of preventing acne and neither of them has anything to do with \"clogged pores.\" Topical acne treatments do not work. If you really want to prevent acne you have to do it internally. Why? Because acne isn't caused by dirty skin or clogged pores, it's caused by an overproduction of oil inside the body. Because of this, the only effective way to stop acne in it's tracks is to slow down this overproduction of oil. There are two known methods for doing this and they both work very well. The first is the prescription only medication Accutane which is actually a derivative of Vitamin A. The second is Vilantae which is based on Vitamin B5. Which is more effective? Actually Accutane is the most effective acne treatment. So why don't I recommend it instead of Vilantae? Simple, Accutane has many negatives going for it. First of all, Accutane is a prescription only medication that is usually only prescribed to those with very bad cases of acne. Secondly, it's very expensive. Thirdly, it has many negative side effects. Vilantae on the other hand does not require a prescription, is very affordable, and has no negative side effects. If you have struggled with acne for a long time and you've tried all of the topical acne treatments then it's definitely time to give Vilantae a try. Vilantae is a completely different approach to preventing acne than topical treatments and that is why it is so extremely effective for most people. Personally I suffered from acne for 7 long years and I tried every single kind of applied acne treatment I could find. None of them did anything! In fact most of them seemed to just make the problem worse. It was then when I had almost completely given up that I discovered Vitamin B5 (Vilantae) and thought, what the heck? I'll try this. I have not made many better decisions in my life. It worked incredibly well for me. Within weeks my acne was completely gone and it has never returned in the years since. Not only did it prevent my acne, but it also seemed to make me feel better overall. And in fact some people take B5 Vitamins for other reasons. Instead of having negative side effects, Vilantae actually has positive side effects! The big draw back that many people have with B5 Vitamin acne treatment is the large amount of capsules you have to take but the good news is now there's an alternative to the capsules. Vilantae now has a liquid version of their product which makes it much easier to follow the plan and become acne free.

Vitamin A fights acne initially by helping to strengthen the protective tissue of the skin. Additionally, it reduces sebum (oil) production in the skin. This combination helps the skin to become more capable of fighting acne and also this healthy skin, with less oil, is less likely to suffer from acne breakouts. Furthermore, Vitamin A is a very strong antioxidant which helps to rid the body, including the skin, of harmful toxins and free radicals, therefore helping to clear the skin of many problems, including acne. Vitamin A is usually taken in conjunction with carotenoids which enhances its effects against acne. Vitamin E is also an antioxidant. Although not as strong of one as Vitamin A, Vitamin E still does help to rid the skin of toxins which can lead to acne and helps to clear up existing acne. Vitamin E also promotes tissue repair and healing of the skin, two important aspects that help to both strengthen the skin and also to prevent damage caused by acne to become permanent. Additionally, Vitamin E prevents cell damage by inhibiting the oxidation of lipids (fats) and the formation of free radicals. As can be seen, both vitamins have fairly similar methods of assisting in the fight against acne. Both help to strengthen the skin and healthier, stronger skin is less prone to acne. Both are also antioxidants and help to clear the skin of acne and prevent future breakouts. The difference is that Vitamin A reduces oil production and Vitamin E promotes tissue repair and healing. In combination, these vitamins are extremely effective in combating acne. Both Vitamin A and Vitamin E are extremely important vitamins and a deficiency in either of them can lead to acne. Consuming healthy amounts of these vitamins every day can help to fight existing acne and also to enable to body to better prevent further acne breakouts from occurring.

","keywords":" acne, acnes, FAQS, FAQ, ACNE, ACNES, faq, faqs ","article_body":" Because acne is the most widespread skin disorder in the world, a lot of research has been done to determine how acne forms and how it is eliminated.  Over the years a number of different treatments, medicines, and products have been developed to help control and eliminate acne. Currently there are about 7 different treatments that are widely used in the prevention and elimination of acne.  Subsequently, there are literally thousands of different products that use these treatments in one form or another. Acne Treatments Accutane (Isotetinoin)  Accutane is a very powerful drug that is a derivative of vitamin A.  It is normally prescribed for severe acne in cases where other treatments have failed to work.  Accutane is normally taken for 4-6 months.  The downside to Accutane is the high occurrence of side effects, some very serious. Antibiotics  Antibiotics are designed to fight bacteria and are thus used to control acne mainly from the inside.  There are topical antibiotics such as clindamycin that are applied directly to the skin.  Other antibiotics such as tetracycline are in pill form. Benzoyl Peroxide  This is an anti-bacterial agent that has been used to control acne for many years.  It has been proven to work very well in the elimination and prevention of acne.  Benzol Peroxide can be found in many prescription and over-the-counter medicines and products. Herbal Remedies  A relative newcomer to mainstream acne fighting are herbal remedies.  It is thought that certain herbs are effective in regulating oil levels and other bodily functions that pertain directly to acne. Retin-A (tretinoin)  Retin-A is a combination of retinoic acid and vitamin A acid.  It is designed to treat acne, wrinkles, and sun damage.  It supposedly does this by unplugging follicles and turnover over dead skin cells. Salicylic Acid  This is another widely used formula in controlling acne, especially preventing future breakouts.  Salicylic acid helps slow down the shedding of cells inside the follicle.  It is available in many over-the-counter treatments. Sulfur  Sulfur is used in acne control mainly to promote drying and peeling of the skin.  This may be good for eliminating existing acne but its effects on preventing future acne are questionable. There you have it.  Most acne regimens consist of one or more of the above formulas.  It is important to note that everyone's skin seems to react differently to these treatments.  For some people, benzoyl peroxide works great.  For others salicylic acid may work better.  You really have to experiment a bit and find out which treatment works best for you.

The hormones are called androgens and increase in both boys and girls when they are going through puberty.  This is the reason why there are so many pre teens and teenagers that have to deal with acne get some form of acne medication to treat it. Another cause of acne is genetics.  If a child has a parent that had to deal with a lot of acne problems as a child, then chances are they will too.  When a pre teen or teenager sees that they are having a problem with acne, it is important for them to seek acne medication to help fight this problem early so that there are no long term affects of the acne. One factor that can cause acne in girls is their menstrual period.  This is a time when hormones are really active and this can cause a flare up of problems in most pre adolescent girls.  There are many acne medications that can treat this problem and get their skin looking perfect again over a time period.  It will take time for the skin to clear up and get back to normal. Pregnancy and birth control pills are another reason why women get acne.  When a woman is pregnant this is a time when her hormones are changing and all different things are happening to her body.  Birth control pills are another source that will cause women to have an acne problem and have to resort to acne medication. Certain medications that people have to take can also cause acne to occur in certain people.  This is typically normal and can affect just about anyone.  Usually once the body accepts the medications the acne will stop or at least lessen.  There are acne medications to help when this is the case. Certain fabrics as well can cause acne to appear also.  Wearing tight collars, backpacks, and hats can bring on a case of acne on any part of the body.  That is another factor; acne can be on any part of the body.  It is not just limited to the face.  When acne appears on different parts of the body, you may be able to control it with over the counter medicine or you may have to go to a doctor for your acne medications. There are many myths of way acne starts, like chocolate or greasy foods.  However, there are no actual links to these rumors and it is not proven.

","keywords":" Acne ","article_body":" Though the exact cause of acne is unknown, many doctors believe it is a direct result of a variety of factors.  One of these factors is the increase in androgens during puberty.  Androgens are hormones, and can cause the enlargement and overstimulation of the sebaceous glands in people with acne. For both males and females, the increase in androgens during puberty can cause these sebaceous glands to produce more sebum, which is oil.  This oil mixes with dead skin cells and bacteria on the skin and blocks pores.  Inside of these blocked pores bacteria multiplies and leads to swelling, which then causes spots and pimples. Some researchers also believe that acne is hereditary, and that people with parents who had acne are likely to inherit acne. Though stress has not been found to be a direct cause of acne, it can lead to aggravated cases of acne.  This happens because when someone is laden with anxiety, their body produces hormones such as cortisol, which exacerbates acne. Other possible causes of acne include certain medications, drugs, steroids, have or oily make-up, and harsh skin cleansing. Greasy foods and dirty skin have often been blamed for acne, but there is little evidence supporting these as direct causes of acne.  Acne is also not contagious.

Every teenager, if examined closely enough will show some of the effects of acne with some being mild, others more severe. The major hormone causing changes in teenagers is androgen. Under its influence, the sebaceous glands produce more and more sebum (oil). This leads, then, to oily skin and a change in skin flora. There is an increase in the bacteria that cause acne as well as a type of fungus. All these contribute to the development of blockages at the oil gland openings known as comedones. Such blockages cause blackheads and whiteheads – and acne when there is infection of the skin’s pores. Acne should not be viewed as something that comes with puberty. It has lasting effects on the skin, like scarring, and should be treated. A gentle skin cleansing without using cleansers that over-dry skin should be established. Addition to that a supplement such as Acuzine should be taken to have a fast and effective acne cure inside out. In adults, acne could be a carryover from adolescence, occupational (exposure to chemicals or other skin irritants in the workplace), drug induced (some medications exacerbate acne) or cosmetic acne. There are also other factors that may contribute to acne besides family history such as frequent use of thick make-up, frequent activities under hot and humid conditions and contact with oily substances. There is nothing much that we can do about genetics but surely we can do something about lifestyle factors to prevent acne. Using thick, oily creams also may lead to breakouts too. People with acne should use products that are formulated for people with oily skin. Stress is another common aggravating factor for acne. Lack of sleep is a form of stress in itself too. And for women, the menstrual cycle can trigger off acne too. But whatever your stage in life with acne, if the acne cream or lotion show no sign of clearing up, then get Acuzine. Acuzine is rate no.1 acne treatment product with guaranteed results. It works for adults or teenagers suffering from facial or body acne.

","keywords":" acne. acnes, faqs, faq, FAQ, FAQS, ACNE, ACNES ","article_body":" Regardless of age, acne is a condition of the sebaceous glands. These glands are attached to hair follicles and produce an oily substance called sebum. An acne lesion forms when a hair follicle becomes plugged with sebum and dead cells. The pathogenic (disease-causing) events in the sebaceous glands are believed to be due in large degree to changes in levels of androgenic (male) hormones in the body—a circumstance usually associated with the growth and development that occurs between the ages of 12 and 21. Therefore, it is important to look for an underlying cause of acne that occurs for the first time in adulthood. Acne that appears after 25 to 30 years of age occurs for one of these reasons 1.\tRecurrence of acne that cleared up after adolescence 2.   Flare-up of acne after a period of relative quiet—for example, during pregnancy 3.   Occurs for the first time in a person who had never previously had acne. Acne that appears for the first time in adulthood should be examined by a dermatologist who can investigate the underlying cause. Some causes of adult acne are *   Medication. Some medications that can induce acne include anabolic steroids (sometimes used illegally by athletes to “bulk up”), some anti-epileptic medications, the anti-tuberculosis drugs isoniazid and rifampin, lithium and iodine-containing medications. *   Chronic physical pressure on the skin. Chafing from the straps of a backpack or tucking a violin between the jaw and chin can cause chronic physical pressure on the skin and may induce a condition known as acne mechanica. *   Chlorinated industrial chemicals. These may induce the occupational skin disorder known as chloracne. *   Metabolic conditions. Changes in the hormonal balance, such as those brought about by pregnancy, menstruation or hormonal abnormalities can induce acne. It is also important to know that some lesions which appear to be acne are not acne at all. One skin condition that resembles acne is folliculitis, which occurs when the hair follicles become infected and inflamed. Folliculitis requires different treatment than acne. Acne that occurs in adulthood may be difficult to treat if there are multiple recurrences. Some patients with severe recurrent acne have undergone repeated courses of treatment with the potent systemic drug isotretinoin. Since adult acne may be difficult to treat, acne that appears for the first time in adulthood should be examined and treated by a dermatologist.

Adding to the problem, your body sheds dead skin cells constantly – and some people have \"sticky\" skin cells that don’t shed normally – they just remain attached to the skin. In people who have acne, these excess skin cells mixes with the oil and plug up the hair follicles. The Common Myths Quite a few myths are floating around out there about what causes acne. Let’s straighten some out right now. - Dirt does not cause acne - A blackhead may look like dirt plugging one of your pores, but that is not the cause. - The sebum and skin cells mix together and sometimes rise to the opening of the pore. But the real cause is still deep inside the pore. - Enjoy your chocolate and French fries. Indulging in these favorites does not increase the production of sebum in the skin. - Some of you may have been told that sexual activity or masturbation can cause acne. Not true. Who Gets More Acne? While both boys and girls can get acne – it’s more likely to be worse in boys because their bodies produce more skin oils. Strangely enough, your immune system can come into play as well – making you extra sensitive to the bacteria that get trapped in the hair follicles. What Makes Acne Worse? - If you use makeup, suntan products or hair products that contain oil – they can add to the pore-plugging problem. - Being under stress – like applying to schools, or struggling with grades, or even dating pressures – can help bring out acne. - During a girl’s period, hormone levels may create more sebum in the skin, which can worsen the breakouts. - And, beware of the sun – not only can it damage your skin and cause premature aging – it can also cause pimples. While keeping your skin clean is an important part of treatment, remember to be gentle – no hard scrubbing, no picking or squeezing. You can survive acne. "},{"title":" What factors causes Acne?

Did you know that common Acne, also known as Acne Vulgaris, is suffered by up to 85% of adolescents and young adults? That is an extremely high portion of the population which is affected by this skin disorder. The cause of Acne is not fully known, but there are several factors which contribute to the development of this inflammatory skin disorder. Your genes play a role in this, meaning if your parents or grandparents suffered this skin condition, you will be prone to getting Acne yourself. Most notably, there is a link to a change in hormonal activity, such as menstrual cycles and puberty. In the past the over production of sebum was considered to be the main cause of Acne. Sebum is an oily secretion of fats and the remains of fat producing cells, caused by hyperactive sebaceous glands in the skin. However, it appears as though the narrowing of follicle channel, where the hair is rooted in the skin, is also a major factor causing common Acne. There are several other factors which can contribute, such as Stress, accumulation of dead skin cells, an allergic reaction to bacteria in the pores, scratching and the usage of anabolic steroids. What has not been confirmed in any way, is the contribution a fatty diet, including chocolate, potato chips and French fries, may have on Acne. Generally, sufferers should experiment with their diet to ascertain what food stuffs affect the severity of their Acne. What could have an influence on Acne is a diet high on refined sugar products. Acne is rare in societies which have not been influenced by our western way of life. These people have a low glycernic level in their diets. However, if the reduction of high glycernic foods, such has soft drinks, sweets and white bread, has a significant effect on alleviating Acne disorders has yet to be proved. Keeping a low consumption of these kinds of foods will influence your general health for the better. Another misconception concerning Acne is personal hygiene. Acne is not caused by dirt, so a poor personal hygiene is not a factor. To make this clearer, Acne causes blockages to occur deep within the follicle or hair channel and as such cannot be washed away. In fact, anything more than a gentle cleansing can cause new lesions by damaging or over drying skin. On a lighter note, if you have heard that celibacy or masturbation can cause Acne and sexual intercourse can cure it, I have good news for you. There is absolutely no scientific evidence at all that this is true. "},{"title":" What Foods Cause Acne Breakouts? ","word_count":729,"summary":" The old adage, “you are what you eat” cannot be truer than when it comes to common causes of acne. Often individuals who do not consume a healthy diet or whose diet lacks the proper amount of critical vitamins and minerals suffer from acne problems. ","keywords":" nutrition, acne care, acne treatment, acne prevention, acne ","article_body":" The old adage, “you are what you eat” cannot be truer than when it comes to common causes of acne. Often individuals who do not consume a healthy diet or whose diet lacks the proper amount of critical vitamins and minerals suffer from acne problems. Remember, you body must be healthy before your skin can be healthy, so strive to eat a well balanced diet, and dedicate yourself to an active lifestyle in order to enjoy unblemished, smooth, and glowing skin. If you are experiencing skin problems, instead of treating your body’s largest organ with harsh chemicals or taking medications that may interfere with your other prescriptions, look first at the nutrition value of your current diet. Work to improve your skin and protect yourself from acne by following these guidelines. ------>Banish Fats, Oils, and Sugars Often times, consuming a diet high in fats, oils, and sugars can wreck havoc on an individual’s skin. Just as these unsavory additions to your diet can cause other issues seen in your body, what you eat directly affects the quality of your skin. Most people have experienced a break out after binging on junk food or fast food, most of which is high in fat, sugar, carbohydrates, and oils. In order to stop break outs associated with eating this unhealthy food, begin to replace these items in your diet with foods that are natural and healthy. ------>Avoid Popular Misconceptions Many individuals are under the misconception that eating certain foods can cause or worsen their acne condition. The most popular food to blame for bad skin is undoubtedly chocolate. Chocolate lovers will take great pleasure in noting that no one specific type of food—including chocolate—has been proven to cause or worsen acne in individuals. However, you should enjoy your chocolate sparingly, as your entire diet can definitely affect the quality of your skin’s appearance, even though one particular item may not be the trigger. ------>Try Organic Foods When looking to change your diet for the better, take care in including fresh, wholesome foods into your new lifestyle. Many individuals have found great success in incorporating organic foods into their diet, since these items lack any added chemicals, preservatives, or potential toxins that can affect both your body and your skin. Furthermore, structure your diet around fresh fruits and vegetables, most of which contain necessary vitamins that will positively affect your entire body. Also, you may want to avoid eating meat products high in fat, since fats can be quickly be stored in your system, lasting long after that greasy burger has been digested. ------>Consider Vitamin and Mineral Supplements Many individuals do not receive the properly daily recommended dose of vitamins or minerals in their diet. For this reason, you should look into including supplements in your daily health regimen. Remember, before consuming any medications or supplements of any kind, be sure to consult your primary health care provider to ensure the dosage is proper and the medication will not negatively interact with your current prescriptions. Too, you may want to find a solid multi-vitamin that is specified for your gender, age, or activity level. Be sure to look for supplements that include Vitamin E, a necessary vitamin when it comes to the health of your skin. ------>Hydrate Your Body Unless you are drinking at least eight eight-ounce glasses of water each day, you are not hydrating your body to a healthy extend. Most individuals are not properly hydrated and their skin pays the price. If you find your skin is dull, ashy, flaky, itchy, or excessively dry, you are not drinking enough water to benefit your body. Hydrated skin is fresh and glowing, so you should drink up to experience these great effects! Also, drinking the proper amount of water on a daily basis will also benefit your overall sense of health. Avoid drinking sodas or sugary sports drinks, since the added sodium and sugar can be detrimental to your healthy lifestyle. By following the above guidelines for clear skin, you can actively work to maintain healthy looking skin that is free of acne. If you find yourself suffering from acne or other skin conditions, focus inward instead for a treatment of this problem instead of slathering your skin with potentially harmful creams or lotions that may cause more harm that good. By eating a proper diet, you will ensure your skin is as healthy as you are. "},{"title":" What Is Acne? ","word_count":507,"summary":" Description and information about acne. Including some of the basic causes. ","keywords":" acne, acne control, acne medicine, acne treatment ","article_body":" Acne is commonly known as pimples, it is a skin condition that commonly afflicts people during their teenage years. Acne pre-dominantly affects the face but can also show up on the back, neck, shoulders and chest. While most common in teenagers it can appear on adults as well. Neither race or gender is an indicator of acne as it affects male and female and all races equally. The medical term for it is Acne Vulgaris. It can be diagnosed by the lesions that form on the skin. These lesions can take several different forms blackheads, whiteheads and cysts. Cysts are formed when the pore becomes completely blocked. Acne is most common during puberty because at this time your body is creating an excess of sebum. Sebum is an oily substance designed to keep the hair and skin soft and lubricated. During puberty the production of sebum is greatly increased which can cause the skin to feel oily and clog pores. During puberty there is also an increase in the production of follicle cells. Dead follicle cells mixed with sebum can build up and cause white heads. This mix of oil and dead cells is a perfect breeding ground for bacterial which will cause the swelling and redness associated with pimples. Acne affects about 85% of all people sometime from the age of 12-24. Around 25% of these people will have acne on their back and/or neck as well as the face. The acne will be severe enough to cause about 40% of these people to seek medical treatment. Acne is most common on the face, especially on the forehead, nose and chin. The back is the next most common area of affliction followed by the neck, chest and shoulders. Most people will have outgrown their acne problems by the time they reach their twenty's, but some people will continue to suffer from acne even as adults. In some cases people will not have any acne issues until they are adults, this happens more frequently in men than women. Acne can have severe emotional and psychological repercussions. Since it affects their appearance it also affects their self image and self esteem. Teenagers are especially vulnerable to this attack on their self-confidence and can even trigger withdraw and depression, as well as feelings of anger and frustration. Fortunately in this day and age there are many treatments that can help with acne. The foremost thing that can be done to help avoid or alleviate acne is to keep the skin as clean and oil free as possible. Washing the most common problem areas several times a day with soap and water, especially after any activity that triggers perspiration, is usually adequate. There are also many medications available by prescription and over the counter to help with acne control. If the acne is severe enough you can consult a dermatologist, they can prescribe medications for the skin as well as antibiotics to help fight the bacteria. They can also offer advise on life style and diet changes that might help with the condition. "},{"title":" What Is Acne – A Brief Users Guide For Parents, Teens And The Rest Of Us.

The medical community is still uncertain as to what triggers this excess production. Sebum is produced by the sebaceous oil gland and everybody needs a small amount to achieve healthy skin. Sebum helps protects the skin from harmful bacteria by washing it away. Types of Acne Lesions The three types of acne lesions are whiteheads & blackheads (also known as closed and open comedones respectively), papules & pustules, and cysts. Whiteheads as the name suggests, look like white bumps. They form under the skin and never reach the surface. This makes them very hard to eliminate. Blackheads grow upward and break the skins surface. This enlarged follicle and the oxidation of the dead cells, sebum, and bacteria have a black color, hence the name. Papules form when a whitehead burst and the bacteria spreads to the surrounding tissues under the skin. This causes your body’s immune system to increase its fight on the infection making the inflammation worse. They appear as small, firm, red bumps. Pustules form as the body’s immune system continues to fight the infection by sending pus to the area. They appear similar to a papules with the addition of a yellowish white head. Cysts are the third and final type of acne lesion. They form when a pustule worsens and expands further down under the skins surface. They appear red or purple and are very painful. This is the most serious of all types of acne lesions. Types of Acne Acne can not only be classified by the types of acne lesions, but further broken down by acne type; depending on what types of lesions you have. People whose acne consists of whiteheads and blackheads would have what is called comedonal acne. A mix of blackheads, whiteheads, papules and pustules acne lesions is called acne vulgaris and is the most common type of acne. The third type of acne is called cystic acne and it is when someone has all three types of acne lesions with numerous cysts. Who Can Get Acne While most people associate acne with teens, anybody can experience some type of acne at any age. That said certain groups of people are more likely to experience acne. They include teens, people under stress, people who have a family history of the disease, people taking certain drugs and adult women. "},{"title":" What is acne?

Acne lesions are commonly referred to as pimples, spots or zits. The condition is common in puberty, especially among Western societies most likely due to a higher genetic predisposition. It is considered an abnormal response to normal levels of the male hormone testosterone. The response for most people diminishes over time and acne thus tends to disappear, or at least decrease, after one reaches their early twenties. There is, however, no way to predict how long it will take for it to disappear entirely, and some individuals will continue to suffer from acne decades later, into their thirties and forties and even beyond. Acne affects a large percentage of humans at some stage in life. Symptoms The most common form of acne is known as \"acne vulgaris\", meaning \"common acne.\" Excessive secretion of oils from the sebaceous glands combines with naturally occurring dead skin cells to block the hair follicles. There also appeares to be in some instances a faulty keritinization process in the skin leading to abnormal shedding of skin lining the pores. Oil secretions build up beneath the blocked pore, providing a perfect environment for the skin bacteria Propionibacterium acnes to multiply uncontrolled. In response, the skin inflames, producing the visible lesion. The face, chest, back, shoulders and upper arms are especially affected. The typical acne lesions are comedones, papules, pustules, nodules and inflammatory cysts. These are the more inflamed form of pus-filled or reddish bumps, even boil-like tender swellings. Non-inflamed 'sebaceous cysts', more properly called epidermoid cysts, occur either in association with acne or alone but are not a constant feature. After resolution of acne lesions, prominent unsightly scars may remain. Aside from scarring, its main effects are psychological, such as reduced self-esteem and depression. Acne usually appears during adolescence, when people already tend to be most socially insecure. Causes of acne Exactly why some people get acne and some do not is not fully known. It is known to be partly hereditary. Several factors are known to be linked to acne Hormonal activity, such as menstrual cycles and puberty Stress, through increased output of hormones from the adrenal (stress) glands. Hyperactive sebaceous glands, secondary to the three hormone sources above. Accumulation of dead skin cells. Bacteria in the pores, to which the body becomes 'allergic'. Skin irritation or scratching of any sort will activate inflammation. Use of anabolic steroids. Any medication containing halogens (iodides, chlorides, bromides), lithium, barbiturates, or androgens. Exposure to high levels of chlorine compounds, particularly chlorinated dioxins, can cause severe, long-lasting acne, known as Chloracne. Traditionally, attention has focused mostly on hormone-driven over-production of sebum as the main contributing factor of acne. More recently, more attention has been given to narrowing of the follicle channel as a second main contributing factor. Abnormal shedding of the cells lining the follicle, abnormal cell binding (\"hyperkeratinization\") within the follicle, and water retention in the skin (swelling the skin and so pressing the follicles shut) have all been put forward as important mechanisms. Several hormones have been linked to acne the male hormones testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), as well as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I). In addition, acne-prone skin has been shown to be insulin resistant. Development of acne vulgaris in latter years is uncommon, although this is the age group for Rosacea which may have similar appearances. True acne vulgaris in older adults may be a feature of an underlying condition such as pregnancy and disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome or the rare Cushing's syndrome. Misconceptions about causes There are many misconceptions and rumors about what does and does not cause the condition Diet. One flawed study purported that chocolate, french fries, potato chips and sugar, among others, affect acne.A recent review of scientific literature cannot affirm either way.The consensus among health professionals is that acne sufferers should experiment with their diets, and refrain from consuming such fare if they find such food affects the severity of their acne.A recent study, based on a survey of 47,335 women, did find a positive epidemiological association between milk consumption and acne, particularly skimmed.The researchers hypothesize that the association may be caused by hormones (such as bovine IGF-I) present in cow milk; but this has not been definitively shown. Seafood, on the other hand, may contain relatively high levels of iodine, but probably not enough to cause an acne outbreak. Still, people who are prone to acne may want to avoid excessive consumption of foods high in iodine. It has also been suggested that there is a link between a diet high in refined sugars and acne. According to this hypothesis, the startling absence of acne in non-westernized societies could be explained by the low glycemic index of these tribes' diets.Further research is necessary to establish whether a reduced consumption of high-glycemic foods (such as soft drinks, sweets, white bread) can significantly alleviate acne, though consumption of high-glycemic foods should in any case be kept to a minimum, for general health reasons. Deficient personal hygiene. Acne is not caused by dirt. This misconception probably comes from the fact that acne involves skin infections. In fact, the blockages that cause acne occur deep within the narrow follicle channel, where it is impossible to wash them away. These plugs are formed by the cells and sebum created there by the body. The bacteria involved are the same bacteria that are always present on the skin. Regular cleansing of the skin can reduce, but not prevent, acne for a particular individual and very little variation among individuals is due to hygiene. Anything beyond very gentle cleansing can actually worsen existing lesions and even encourage new ones by damaging or overdrying skin. Sex. Common myths state that either celibacy or masturbation cause acne and, conversely, that sexual intercourse can cure it. There is absolutely no scientific evidence suggesting that any of these are factual. It is true, though, that anger and stress affect hormone levels and thus bodily oil production. Whether or not any increases in oil production due to stress are enough to cause acne is currently being researched. "},{"title":" What Is Acne And Who Gets Acne?

About 40% of adolescents and teenagers suffer from severe problems that require the assistance of a physician to be cured. When does it start? Acne hits between the ages of ten and thirteen. The condition persists for the next five to ten years. It normally disappears in the early twenties though it can stay till one is in their late twenties, thirties or even later than that. There have been cases when people start getting acne when they are well into adulthood. Men or women? There has been no concrete evidence to show whether men or women suffer more from acne. But young men are more prone to the different forms of acne than women. For men acne is far more severe and lasts really longer than women. Despite this men do not visit the dermatologist as often as they should. Young women usually have acne that occurs intermittently. This is caused by hormonal changes that are associated with the menstrual cycle. Acne can also be caused by the use of cosmetics without understanding whether they are suitable to the particular skin type or not. These kinds of acne can happen to women who are well into their adulthood. Where do they occur? Acne can occur most commonly on the face but they also occur on the chest, back, shoulders, scalp, neck, upper arms and legs.

Acne laser treatment is just what it sounds like. The technician will use a very powerful and small laser to effectively trigger the acne. Usually, the procedure will be done because the acne is being caused, at least in part, by over producing oils in the skin. The laser will get to these glands that are under the skin and causing the oils and destroy them. While this seems harsh, laser acne treatment is virtually painless. There are no ramifications to having these glands destroyed either. Once the glands stop producing oils, the bacteria that cause acne will not have an optimal place to grow. This in turn effectively stops acne. It is important to know that in most causes acne treatments will not necessary cure the acne that is already on your face or body. This will usually be done with antibiotics. Once the oils slow or stop though, there will be fewer outbreaks of acne on the face or body once these heal. Scar Treatment Another option for the use of acne laser treatment is that in which the acne scars can be removed. This very powerful laser can actually remove the top layers of your skin near and on the scar. When new skin grows back, it will be healthy and scars are either gone or they are not as visible.

As far as the medical community stands, back acne also happens when oil glands start functioning more rapidly around puberty. The hormone group androgens, found in both females and males, get overactive which in turn causes a reaction in the oil glands, which make extra oil. The oil glands are located just underneath the skin surface. Oil glands constantly are producing and secreting oil through the pores in the skin. When too much of the oils are produced the pores and hair follicles become clogged. The clogs obstruct the way that dead cells escape the skin, which in turn results in a mess of oil and dead cells plugging the hair follicle. This attracts bacterium, which causes the acne to be formed. Back acne can be found on any part of the body and does not necessarily have to be on a person's back. It can be very severe with large lesions and painful cysts. Back acne may just be something that certain people are prone to or it could be caused by other things such as tight clothing or a heavy backpack. Not having anything in contact with the back is not a logical prevention step, as we all must sit down and everyone has to wear clothing. Back acne comes in all sizes and forms of acne, ranging from mild forms like whiteheads to serious forms of acne including cystic acne. 'Bacne' as it is referred to in slang terms, can consist of pimples, pustules and blackheads as well. Back acne affects people ranging from age ten to age forty or older yet. Understanding the causes of back acne and available treatment options, are very important is treating and preventing the condition. There are some differences in back acne and acne located elsewhere on the body however. Back acne is not caused by genetics as other acnes can be. Some severe cases of back acne may be genetically passed on but most likely it is just the individual's body type or personal genetic make up. People all over the world suffer from back acne at some point in their lives. Unlike other acne, food does not contribute to the formation or flare up of back acne. There is absolutely no evidence that foods cooked in grease, or high in fat content contribute to back acne. It is also known that excessive oil production and dirt build up does not have a huge impact on developing back acne. Perspiring excessively and not washing or showering immediately has been shown to not increase the chances of developing back acne. Back acne also does not seem to be affected by stress. There are some who think that facial acne is increased due to stress. However stress can cause back acne to not heal. Oftentimes, stress causes people to pick and bother the pimples, which make the condition worse. It is easier to treat back acne than to try and prevent it because most people suffer from back acne at one time or another. Skin on the back is much thicker and therefore allows for stronger topical treatments, such as ten percent Benzoyl peroxide. This strength of Benzoyl peroxide is not suitable for other skin that is typically thinner and will not be able to sustain itself under harsh treatment. You can get all the same types of acne, blackheads, whiteheads, papules, pustules and cysts, on your back just as you can on any other part of your body. Taking some over the counter medicines may treat breakouts of back acne in conditions that are not complex. Some skin specialists or dermatologists should treat severe forms of acne on the back, such as cystic acne. Most of the simpler forms of acne might disappear with daily washing and cleansing routines but as cystic acne goes deep into the skin and can cause permanent scarring, it should be given more serious medical attention than simple pustules or blackheads on the back. Always speak to your healthcare provider about treatment before starting a back acne treatment program never attempt to treat severe acne on your own or with an over the counter product without consulting a professional.

Here are some things you should know about Benzoyl peroxide. ","keywords":" acne, benzoyl peroxide, acne treatment, proactiv, proactive, skin care ","article_body":" One of the most common ingredients found in acne treatment medications is benzoyl peroxide. It is known for its acne fighting properties. It is a chemical found in organic peroxide. Benzoyl peroxide is called an active ingredient in products because it causes a chemical change upon contact with the skin. It produces a chemical compound of benzoic acid and oxygen that peels the top layer of dead cells off the skin surface. This peeling effect cleans the pores more deeply than a normal application of soap and water. Benzoyl peroxide is found in a wide variety of products because it is known for its mildness on the skin. Another of the most common ingredients found with benzoyl peroxide is salicylic acid. A combination of these two active ingredients is found in popular acne treatment brands like Oxy-10 and Clearasil. While both have been tested for their acne fighting properties, they have not been proven to be any more effective combined. Salicylic acid can be harmful for women who are pregnant, causing birth defects. This has been proven in cases where the salicylic acid is ingested orally. It has not been totally proven in cases where the salicylic acid is applied topically, but if you’re a mother, do you really want to run that risk. The best idea is to stay away from the salicylic acid completely. There are many products out there that are effective that have no salicylic acid in them. One of the most popular acne treatments sold today is   <a href=http//www.crescatsententia.org>Proactiv solution</a>, a product that is endorsed by many high profile celebrities including Jessica Simpson, Puff Daddy, and Lindsay Lohan. Proactiv has been tested and proven to be effective using a combination of ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide and sulfur. It also has anti-inflammatory ingredients such as aloe vera that help the skin stay moisturized. Clean, moist skin is one of the most important factors in maintaining and preventing further acne. Of course, there are cases where benzoyl peroxide has been reported to irritate and dry out the skin. Dry and irritated skin and hair follicles have the highest susceptibility to new acne, so it is important to have the correct dosage of benzoyl peroxide for your own personal needs. <a> href=http//crescatsententia.org>Proactive</a> has a fairly low level of benzoyl at 2.5%, which helps keep skin irritation to a minimal. There are several products out on the market today, such as NeoBenz Micro that contains higher concentrations of up to 8.5%. Because of this high dose NeoBenz is only available with a prescription.

An enduring myth about acne is that squeezing blackheads can clear up the acne faster. This myth is not only false, but following this advice can also cause long-lasting harm to the skin. Pimples can be classified into two types. There is the non inflammatory type, which is essentially whiteheads and blackheads, also called closed comodones and open comodones respectively. Whiteheads are plugged follicles below the surface of the skin. Blackheads on the other hand are enlarged plugs that look like minute black spots and push through the skin’s surface. Then there are the inflammatory types which are further classified into papules, which are pinkish in color and tender to the touch; pustules, which are small and round lesion like pimples with a red base and a yellowish centre; and nodules or cysts, which is the most severe form of acne, and are large and extremely painful and tend to leave scars. Squeezing blackheads is more likely to harm than heal. As tempting as it can be, squeezing comedones can injure the sebaceous follicle and the tissue around it and force the contents, the bacteria, deeper into the skin tissue and also force its contents to extrude to the skin surface. This can result in inflammation of the skin. Also, scientific evidence suggests that blackheads not be removed by using blackhead extractors that are so commonly available on the Internet or magazine ads. A fully developed blackhead will not become inflamed if left alone. Moreover, squeezing whiteheads can be potentially even more damaging. Whiteheads, also called sandpaper comedo, are so small that they can hardly be seen, and are more likely to be felt as roughness on the skin. a whitehead is more likely than a blackhead to become inflamed, and further evolve into a pustule or a papule. When whiteheads naturally evolve into papules or pustules, they should be treated by a dermatologist. Acne can be severely exacerbated if you attempt to squeeze the inflammatory type of lesions. Also whiteheads are so small, that there is hardly any content in it to squeeze out so overall the whole squeezing experience can be rather unsatisfying! A regular acne treatment, based upon your specific type of problem, cause and skin type is by far the best way to keep your acne under control.

You must obtain the required knowledge to make informed decisions about treating your acne. ","keywords":" acne, health, treatment ","article_body":" If you are considering starting your own home business, one of the first things you must think about is budgeting and planning to find the money you need.  You can start the planning process from your kitchen table if necessary.  You'll need a telephone with an answering machine to handle calls while you're budgeting and planning.  It is important that you project a favorable image. So in addition to the phone, you will need good quality business cards, which should include your name, the company name, phone number, web site and e-mail address.  A computer with appropriate software is a necessity for internet marketers. A calculator and a file cabinet would be nice but can wait a while. Once you are organized and have an internet marketing plan, your next move will be to begin your home business budgeting and planning to find the money you need to get started.  Once you get the word out that you are ready to open your business, you can begin to try to locate a source to provide the capital you need.  Some internet marketers build a successful business with no start-up money, but in general you will need at least a small amount of money to get started. There are many individuals who are willing to invest in small internet marketing venture.  Their willingness to invest depends upon the likelihood of your success, so be sure you explore all the options and choose your type of online business wisely.  An investor is, after all, in business for the same reason you are, which is to make money.  You can begin by advertising, personally contacting investors who want to make a profit during the process of lending you money.  The old saying, \"if at first you don't succeed, try, try again,\" applies here because if one lender is not willing to lend you money, chances are someone else will. The more you advertise your services, the more likely you are to find the money you need as indicated by your budgeting and planning process.  One way to begin is to run an advertisement in the \"Investors Wanted\" column in the classified section of a local newspaper.  It might read like this  \"Money needed internet marketing venture.  Call 555-555-5555.\" You should run your ad as often as you can in all the newspapers in your area for at least a month if you can afford it.  The money for these ads will come out of the advertising budget that you created during the budgeting and planning process.  This budgeting and planning for your home business is necessary in order to for you to find the money you need to become a successful internet marketer. An additional or alternative ad could be run simultaneously with the other ads you are running.  The purposes of these dual ads will be to reach as many potential investors as possible.  You will possibly attract more than one investor, which will enable you to compare their terms and repayment options. When you place your ads, you can list them under any or all of the following categories in the classified section  \"Business Opportunities Wanted; \"Financial & Loans Wanted;\" or \"Money to Loan.\"  When you have responses to your ads, it is time to set up individual meetings with the potential lender.  Your home business and budget planning, if done properly, can result in finding the money you need to become a successful and highly profitable internet marketer.

","keywords":" Acne Medications ","article_body":" There are over 50 million people in America alone who suffer from acne and sadly this permits for exploitation from the many marketers and impostors out to make a fast buck at the expense of the vulnerable and desperate. Now, I was once in the category of the frantic and susceptible, in my desperate attempts to get rid of my acne-both as a teenager and a young adult- but not anymore. After adopting the use of drug-free methods of curing my acne such as a drastic change in my diet, facial massaging and other basic hygienic steps such as changing my pillow-cases daily, having a towel that was exclusively for my face etc, I have since swore off the use of acne medications as I am of the firm belief that most don’t work and may actually aggravate an already debilitating situation. Now friends, I tried it all (well everything except plastic surgery) Proactive, Clearasil, Neutrogena, Benzoyl peroxide medications…you name it, I tried it and from my experience, nothing worked. One product would probably just dry my skin out that I’d literally have to rotate my jaw just to get elasticity back in my face; while the other would so irritate my skin, I’d have to be so careful not to even touch it. Moreover, thinking about the time I spent and wasted using these products actually makes me laugh. For one I had to use a cleanser, then the mask (10-15 minutes for this one folks) and afterwards a toner and ‘concealer’? Now, keep in mind, I’m a guy and no, I’m not in show-business. Let’s take a look at some other popular products like Adapalene gel (Differin), Clindamycin phosphate (Cleocin T), Azelic acid (Azelex), Tretinoin. Friends, most people-like I did -develop side effects from using prescription topical acne remedy medications. These include stinging, burning, redness, peeling, scaling, or discoloration of the skin. Hey, aren’t we trying to get a smoother skin here…?! In addition, when I was prescribed tetracycline and minocycline, both on different occasions by a dermatologist for oral medication, I had to deal with upset stomach, dizziness and lightheadedness which usually kicked in within minutes after use. Moreover, I was told I’d have to take oral antibiotics for as long as 4 to 6 months for an effective acne treatment! 4-6 months…?! Now I don’t know about you, but that is an awfully long time to wait for an acne remedy to work, especially when a natural inexpensive alternative for the treatment of acne could give you the same results in less than 7 to 10 days when done properly. Thankfully my acne has since gone and though I mentioned I wasn’t in show business above, maybe I’d give it a shot eh? That’s how improved my skin condition is and how much more confident I feel and this is from a guy who loathed and cringed to have his picture taken or to even step out from his room. We all differ, so if you’ve had success from acne medications, by all means feel free to use them, however, if like the majority you have had no success with the wide range of so called acne remedies then why not try alternative methods of clearing up your skin. It worked for me and chances are it can work for you. Here’s to a clearer skin naturally. "},{"title":" Why The Best Acne Treatment May Be a Change in Diet ","word_count":523,"summary":" This article explains why the best possible treatment for acne may be a change in diet. ","keywords":" diet, acne, treatment, pimple, health, skin ","article_body":" Western medicine is notoriously sophisticated when it comes to drug formulations and targeted medicine approached from a perspective based in deductive science.  It has, however, been largely a failure when it comes to being open to solutions to medical problems which come from outside the realm of deductive science. That is why for years western medicine failed to draw ties between diet and acne.  Medical development, and treatments for acne sufferers, has progressed significantly within the last 15 years alone.  Yet the problem of acne has remained largely uncurbed, until recently. In the past few years empirical studies first trickled and are now flooding in indicating that there are links between acne and diet.  The basic premise of the research is that eating refined carbohydrates and sugar is the ultimate culprit for many individuals’ problems with acne.  The scientific theory holds that when carbohydrates and sugar are metabolized they lead to an increase in insulin and an insulin-like growth factor called IGF-1 production.  This growth factor then causes male hormones to begin being produced in the body in much greater quantities.  These growth hormones lead directly to an increase the amount of sebum produced.  Sebum is the grease-like substance that comes out in your pores which people often describe as ‘oily skin’.  Sebum then clogs your pores and ultimately causes to an accumulation of bacteria in those pores which cannot escape because of the sebum. This of course ultimately leads to acne. That rather exhaustive explanation explains simply this; when you consume refined carbohydrates and sugars you may aggravate your skin, clog your pores, and develop acne. So, what is the answer? Not surprisingly, it may be to cut back on sugars and refined carbs such as sweets and pastas.  These foods provide us with very few of the nutrients we need while providing us with a great deal more by way of clogged pores. In fact, recent studies are showing that these foods may be so bad for you that your body actually fights them like it does a disease, through the production of white blood cells.  Not only do these white blood cell expenditures temporarily lower your immune system, but they also cause your body to produce more waste, some of which is exuded through your pores. But it may surprise you to know that giving up chocolate and spaghetti may not be the only way to go about getting clearer skin.  Rather, there are a number of foods, in particular raw vegetables and antioxidants which can actively clear up skin.  These foods act as a sort of mop within the body to soak up toxins, also known as free radicals, which are often expelled as bacteria through the skin. So in effect, following a better diet can attack the problem of acne in two different ways, cutting back on sugars and refined carbs will cause your body to produce less of the pore clogging sebum, while increasing your intake of certain raw vegetables will significantly cut down on the amount of bacteria which is exuded through your pores.  Combined, these two techniques will cut down significantly your propensity to suffer acne. "},{"title":" Why Use Acne Medicine. ","word_count":455,"summary":" Many people have to deal with acne.

Well, based on what some people say about Positive thinking and all, I guess I allowed it to have too much control over me. However, at that age, how the heck was I to know about all that? Moreover, with bumps, bumps and more bumps all over my face, it was kind of hard you know. I doubt if any girl would have wanted to kiss a guy with a big red bump nestled on his lip today or his nose the next. Needless to say those were sad years and had I known then what I know now about acne, folks, it would have been a different story. Either way it goes, I still come across helpless and understandably sad teenagers almost on a daily basis so if it helps any if you are a teenager or know of a teenager who is plagued with pimples, here are a few tips that should help you cure your acne in no time. 1. First and foremost, I care not what some sites and product endorsers say about how diet doesn’t affect acne; you have got to make a change in your eating habits, plain and simple. You are what you eat. If you want to have clearer skin and the added bonus of improved health, of course eating right will be essential. That said Fruits and vegetables friends. Shop more in the produce aisle and steer clear of the snack stands at the cash register. I know it may sound boring for a teenager but trust me, it’s worth the sacrifice and this forms the basis of an internal acne treatment right there from its root cause. 2.For external acne-care, you could learn such simple tips as facial massaging and exercises. However, (now I’m speaking from what I went through and believe me I had acne BAD…) simply washing your face with nothing but clean hands and plain cool water may perhaps be the most efficient way to clean the pores. Combined with the facial massaging and occasional steaming of the face, this will be very sufficient to clean the skin. 3. Change your pillowcases daily and make sure you have a towel exclusively for your face or you could employ the use of paper towels. 4. If you use greasy hair-products, shampoo the hair before retiring or at least use a clean do-rag to hinder the introduction of oily substances to the pillowcase and inevitably your face while asleep. 5. On that subject, try to also sleep on the right side. Besides checking against contaminations getting on the face, this is great for the heart and lungs and allows for a better and restful sleep (which co-incidentally helps with controlling acne.) 6. Deal with stressful situations amicably. This is another topic into itself but briefly these work Proper diet (factor #1), proper thinking habits and exercise. For stress, allow me to mention Yoga-don’t have the space to explain why, but friends, with its sun-exercises and its derivative, Hindu push-ups, Yoga is awesome for stress-relief. Moreover, for teenagers who are more likely to engage in sports and other recreational activities, you’ll be getting the added advantage of improving your fitness levels and with your own body weight at that. Boy, had I known of some of these in my time. Well, don’t let the story of my teenage years be yours, a sad one because of one thing-Acne. With the tips above, I can confidently assure you it won’t be the case. Just remember you owe me and my payment is to pass it on to your friends if they need it. (I want every teen with acne to know of this…chuckle) Here’s to a clearer skin naturally.

Zinc acts as an antioxidant and this is one primary reason why it is so helpful against acne. Antioxidants help to clear the body of toxins and free radicals. These can cause various problems in different areas of the body, and in the skin these can lead to pimples and acne breakouts. Keeping the skin, the largest organ in the body, clear is only too important. Zinc helps to keep the skin clear and healthy and prevent the build-up of these toxins and free radicals, therefore being proactive and helping to prevent acne breakouts altogether. Zinc is also proactive in the way that it regulates the oil glands. Although what exactly causes pimples is not known, it is known that the sebum excreted from the oil glands plays a big part in the formation of the pimples. Proper oil regulation can lead to fewer and smaller pimples and helps to prevent them from spreading once they do occur. The advantage here is clear and shows why Zinc can help to stop acne before it starts. Once acne has occurred, Zinc is extremely important due to it being involved in healing tissue and preventing scarring. Those nasty acne scars that result from acne can be healed and prevented when proper amounts of Zinc are present in the body. Acne causes numerous problems and damages the skin in many ways and Zinc helps to heal this damage and keep the scarring to a minimal level. Zinc also promotes a healthy immune system and helps in the healing of wounds, to top it off. A healthy immune system also lends a hand to preventing acne and Zinc helps to maintain that healthy immune system in a variety of ways. This is just icing on the cake for those who decide to take Zinc to help with their acne since taking Zinc will also make their immune systems that much healthier and perform that much better. As is readily seen, the advantages of Zinc in the body, both in how it is necessary to fight and prevent acne and due to it being active in maintaining a healthy immune system, are numerous. A Zinc deficiency can be a leading cause of acne and therefore it is necessary for anyone looking to prevent future acne breakouts to look to consume healthy amounts of Zinc each and every day. "}]}
